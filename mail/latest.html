            <h2>
                Marc Randolph Former Netflix CEO on The Diary Of A CEO Podcast
            </h2>
            <p>
                This whole conversation is fascinating, and I've never heard TK's story before.
                There are a ton of business insights packed throughout this episode; however, two really stood out to me as novel and interesting.
            </p><p>
                1. "There is no such thing as a good idea. [...] Rather than dreaming about how amazing this idea is, the first thing you think about and the only thing you think about is how can I quickly and cheaply collide this idea with a real person and find out is it in fact a good idea or bad idea."
            </p><p>
                He goes on to tell a story about a college girl validating a clothes borrowing website; it is fantastic.

            </p><p>
                2. "Q: Hard work, does it matter? Well, since you asked it so simply, I'd say no."
            </p><p>
                The context for this answer is incredible, particularly his part two story about planes.
                It is seriously worth the listen for all you contrarian thinkers out there.

                How To Lose 20â€“30 Pounds In 5 Days: The Extreme Weight Cutting and Rehydration Secrets of UFC Fighters by Tim Ferris
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm not sure how useful this is for most people, but I found it very interesting nonetheless.
                I had been wondering for a while how someone could lose so much weight and, in the case of bodybuilders, get extra shredded for competitions so fast.
                Did it require some kind of super expensive diet?
                Was it mainly just taking a supplement that dries you out?
                Well, this has the answers.
                If you ever seen me absolutely diced in a future photoshoot, you'll know why lol.
                (If you read the article, you'll also know that I probably feel like death too.)

            <p>
                To put it succinctly, this is what always-on AI should be.
                Using AI to connect people in ways not possible before is very exciting.
                I'd love to hear anything you might have to say on this topic.
