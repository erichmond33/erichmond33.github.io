                            Four years ago I began to notice the amazing things Ai was capable of, and immediately I felt like the world was leaving me behind. In order to resolve some of my intense anxiety I decided it was time to learn just how this Ai stuff worked. However, first I had to learn to program!

                            After I felt like I had a firm footing in programming, (which I didn’t) I was ready to tackle Ai. I took some an Udemy course, and I was struggling with basic setup of a programming project. I really just wasn’t proficient with computers at the time, and ultimately ended up quitting. While I didn’t do any of the projects, I did watch all of the videos and gained a very intuitive sense of the field.

This was actually really fun to see what I could make the robot do despite its trivial nature.

                                Riding high I began my way deep into the depths of “deep learning”. I was already quite familiar with basic models from the books and previous Udemy course, but this specialization really dove fairly deep into the underlying math. While I did my best to soak it all up there are undoubtedly parts I won’t remember. Nonetheless, I got the chance to build some pretty neat stuff in this course.

                                This past summer I really wanted to build something “official”. I had pretty much reached the limit of what I could do with Ai given my limited compute power, and I had been doing some research into the crypto space. I thought the technology had potential, so I set out to build a website in order to truly learn these technologies, starting with this course.

                                This project ultimately flopped completely, but that was what I expected. The point of it was to help me learn how to actually use the ethereum blockchain, and see what 10 hour work days are actually like over the course of a month and a half. Now I can truthfully say that I am willing to work these insane hours because I know exactly what it is like. I would love to have a chance to further explain my thoughts on this project. Please take a minute to check out the website.

                                This has nothing to do with CS, but  a very important This was an event at my high school I proposed and created in 11th grade to help one of my teachers struggling with leukemia. It was basically a tee shirt fundraiser and a basketball game to help her with the crazy medical bills. This is probably my proudest moment because not only was it for a great cause, but I learned so much about the coordination of many “moving parts” and people.
