            Research
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm working under Dr. Jake Qualls at Astate doing research with the No Boundaries Thinking program, a collaboration with 7 out of 9 colleges on campus. Our thesis is to use a generative adversarial network (Ai model) to create the most comprehensible font for dyslexic readers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, we will be giving tests to dyslexic students to collect the data our model will use. My current job is to build the website - frontend and backend - that this test will be taken on. Once we collect our data I get to start on the Ai stuff. 
        </p>

            My other job?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm also getting my real estate license.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a long story why I decided to, but it should be useful and fun.

        <h2>
            Artificial Intelligence
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm catching up on a lot of the newer papers out there, but no official personal projects right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'd like to meet more people/groups interested or working in this field. Email me :)

            College

            I am pursing an undergraduate degree in computer science with a minor in business at Arkansas State University.

        <p>
            I'm really only interested in Lens Protocol right now.

        <h2>
            Projects (in general)
        </h2>
        <p>
            I haven't found something really interesting in a while.
        </p>

            What are you working on? Maybe you could inspire me and maybe I could help? :)
