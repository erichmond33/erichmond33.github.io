            <p>
            I was accepted into a REU (Research Experiences for Undergrads) program at East Carolina University.
            I'm not sure exactly what I'll be working on right now, but I'm pretty excited about it.
            </p><p>
            This is my focus right now.
            </p>

            Blog & Muse
            </h2>
            <p>
            I just spent the past week blogging daily.
            I liked it, but I think it could be better.
            </p>
            <p>
            The plan is to either blog or muse each day.
            I say daily because I need it to be a habit, else it won't get done.
            </p>
            <p>
            (Musing is just me sitting in silence with a notebook in hand.
            My thoughts are often directed towards whatever project I am working on.
            But the mind wanders, and that is ok.)
            </p>

            I'm writing a post about my experience.
            I'll link it here when it is finished.

            What I did...

            <p>I'm trying to figure out my relationship with creativity.
            I've decided to cut out all distractions and focus on whatever this is.</p>

            <p>For the whole spring semester I plan on trying to make beautiful things, and figure out how I might contribute something to the world in a way that I enjoy.</p>

            <p>I'm renting out an office space - of sorts - to ensure I have a consistent quiet place.</p>

            <p>Everything else doesn't matter to me right now.</p></blockquote>

            I have nothing left to do on this until we get real data collected, so I'm temporarily not working on this.

            I'm working under Dr. Jake Qualls at Astate doing research with the No Boundaries Thinking program, a collaboration with 7 out of 9 colleges on campus. Our thesis is to use a generative adversarial network (Ai model) to create the most comprehensible font for dyslexic readers.
            </p>
            <p>
            In short, we will be giving tests to dyslexic students to collect the data our model will use. My job was to build to website that the tests will be given from and build the Ai model.
