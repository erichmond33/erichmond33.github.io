            <h2>
                I Feel Crazy
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sooo I wrote a <a href="/book">memoir.</a>
                It feels good to be out there.
            </p><p>
                For an update on my plans after college, read the last chapter, "Figuring Out Forward"
            </p><p>
                (The book is free.)
            </p>
            <h2>
                Tennis
            </h2>
            <p>
                I started playing in a tennis league in November.
                Jonesboro actually has a pretty good tennis community; I made some friends along the way.
            </p><p>
                It was a ton of fun, and I'm looking forward to it starting back up in the Spring.
            </p><p>
                In the meantime, holler at me if you wanna play :)
            </p>
            <h2>
                Maintence
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm eating around 2500 calories right now - maybe a little more - which is what I need to maintain my weight.
            </p><p>
                At 8:30pm I go to the gym which is usually 10 mins of running or the stair stepper along with 16 sets of whatever I'm feeling like. Just breakin a sweat.
            </p><p>
                I read for about an hour a day. Also, I write for about an hour as well.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Infinite Jest
            </h2>
            <p>
                I basically never read fiction because it feels like a waste of time.
                This book opened my eyes to what fiction could be.
                I will be open to finding really great fiction after reading this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of me telling you why this is such a great book, do this.

                A dumb PS2 game
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you read my last now update, well, we beat this stupid game lol.
                I'm pretty sure my brother and I are apart of a VERY exclusive group of people who have done this.
