                Welp, it is my last year.
                Right now I'm gearing up to start applying to some jobs in Austin, TX - the place I'd like to go once I graduate.
                I don't know anyone in Austin, so I don't have very high hopes of landing anything, well, at all really.
                Still, I will give it my best effort.
                Given my nature, I'm also very open to creating my own job, so we will see how this whole thing unfolds over the next year.
                I'm excited!
            </p>

                My next project
            </h2>
            <p>
                I've got some ideas.
                It seems like one is pretty good.
                But most likely I'll start something out of pure necessity after searching for jobs awhile.
            </p><p>
                The scariest thing in the world is getting stuck at a job with bad culture or <a href="https://bloge.li/articles/2023-08-15" target="_blank">work that isn't significant</a>.
            </p>

                Maintenance
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm eating around 2500 calories right now - maybe a little more - which is what I need to maintain my weight.
            </p><p>
                Right now I'm running 2 miles about 3-4 days a week.
                Although, I went to the pool today to swim laps and it was great cardio, so I might start doing that more often.
                At 8:30pm I go to the gym which is usually 10 mins of running or the stair stepper along with 16 sets of whatever I'm feeling like.
                Oh, also I play pickleball pretty often - also great cardio.
                Holler at me if you want the smoke ;)
            </p><p>
                I read for about an hour a day.
                Also, I'll write for about an hour as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                This was such a great experience.
                I am so grateful for this opportunity, and I already miss all the amazing people that I got to become friends with.

                I was accepted into a REU (Research Experiences for Undergrads) program at East Carolina University.
            </p><p>
                I'll be spending my entire summer here in North Carolina doing AI research.
            </p><p>
                It has been two weeks so far.
                I am having a blast.
                The mentors are just fantastic, and the other students are very engaged with the work.
                It is nice to have people I can talk AI to!
            </p><p>
                My research topic is teaching large language models (think chatGPT) to use a calculator.
                They are great at mathematical reasoning but not very good at actually crunching numbers, so I'm hoping to push this idea forward a bit.
                More generally, I'm interested in getting them to use any tool.
                But for now, I'm focused on the calculator.
            </p><p>
                Staying in the dorm has been more fun than I expected.
                It has been interesting to be able to hang out with people at almost any time.
            </p><p>
                TLDR; 
                I'm getting paid to work on what I want to.
                I've got nice people to relax with.
                Life is good.

                A dumb PS2 game
            </h2>
            <p>
                My brother and I enjoy playing old PS2 games occasionally.
                And occasionally we get really into them.
                Right now we are playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabela%27s_Outdoor_Adventures_(2005_video_game)" target="_blank">Cabelas Outdoor Adventures 2005</a> on the <i>hardest</i> setting.
                It is ridiculously hard, so we have to resort to weird buggy/cheaty-ish ways to actually complete hunts.
            </p>
            <p>
                An added bonus to wasting so much time on this old game is that nobody even knows what it is nor understands just how hard it is to play on the hardest setting lol.
                It is great.
