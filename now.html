            <p>
            I'm working under Dr. Jake Qualls at Astate doing research with the No Boundaries Thinking program, a collaboration with 7 out of 9 colleges on campus. Our thesis is to use a generative adversarial network (Ai model) to create the most comprehensible font for dyslexic readers.
            </p>
            <p>
            In short, we will be giving tests to dyslexic students to collect the data our model will use. My job was to build to website that the tests will be given from. Now I get to begin on the Ai stuff as we roll into data collection!

            <p>
            I am pursing an undergraduate degree in computer science with a minor in business at Arkansas State University.

            I'm in my Junior year - by hours anyways.

            <p>
            I've finally started working on an interesting project.
            It is very early, so I'll let it develop a little more before I say anything else about it.

            Crypto

            <p>
            I haven't done anything in crypto for some time now.

            It seems like the killer app is right on the tip of everybody's tongues.

            What are you working on? :)
            
            I'd love to hear it.
