            Summer Job
            </h2>
            <p>
                I was accepted into a REU (Research Experiences for Undergrads) program at East Carolina University.
            </p><p>
                I'll be spending my entire summer here in North Carolina doing AI research.
            </p><p>
                It has been two weeks so far.
                I am having a blast.
                The mentors are just fantastic, and the other students are very engaged with the work.
                It is nice to have people I can talk AI to!
            </p><p>
                My research topic is teaching large language models (think chatGPT) to use a calculator.
                They are great at mathematical reasoning but not very good at actually crunching numbers, so I'm hoping to push this idea forward a bit.
                More generally, I'm interested in getting them to use any tool.
                But for now, I'm focused on the calculator.
            </p><p>
                Staying in the dorm has been more fun than I expected.
                It has been interesting to be able to hang out with people at almost any time.
            </p><p>
                TLDR; 
                I'm getting paid to work on what I want to.
                I've got nice people to relax with.
                Life is good.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am pursing an undergraduate degree in computer science at Arkansas State University.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm expected to graduate in the spring of 2024.
