            Focus & Creativity
            </h2>

            <p>I'm trying to figure out my relationship with creativity.
            I've decided to cut out all distractions and focus on whatever this is.</p>

            <p>For the whole spring semester I plan on trying to make beautiful things, and figure out how I might contribute something to the world in a way that I enjoy.</p>

            <p>I'm renting out an office space - of sorts - to ensure I have a consistent quiet place.</p>

            <p>Everything else doesn't matter to me right now.</p>

            <h2>
            Research
            </h2>
            <p>
            I have nothing left to do on this until we get real data collected, so I'm temporarily not working on this.
            </p>
            <blockquote style="color:#666;"><p>  
            I'm working under Dr. Jake Qualls at Astate doing research with the No Boundaries Thinking program, a collaboration with 7 out of 9 colleges on campus. Our thesis is to use a generative adversarial network (Ai model) to create the most comprehensible font for dyslexic readers.
            </p>
            <p>
            In short, we will be giving tests to dyslexic students to collect the data our model will use. My job was to build to website that the tests will be given from and build the Ai model.

            <p>
            I am pursing an undergraduate degree in computer science with a minor in business at Arkansas State University.

            I'm in my Junior year - by hours anyways.
