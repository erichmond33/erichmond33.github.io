            Crypto
        </h2>
        <p>
            I really enjoy all things crypto. Being a programmer, I'm more interested in the technology than the speculation. However, I do have a few <i>long term</i> investments of my own. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm really captivated by Lens Protocol and a decentralized form of social media. There seems to be serious potential there, but I can see several pitfalls as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would love to dive into a project seeing as I am a full stack developer and a solidity developer as well. I'm always looking for important problem	s to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall I'm just really excited with the entire field. If anyone has questions about crypto or smart contracts, I'd be happy to help in any way I can :) Just shoot me an email
        </p>

            Artificial Intelligence
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm really not doing anything in Ai right now despite it being my first love. All the innovation is happening with these gigantic models that I can only read about. Although, I'm certain that Ai will play a large part in any business that I start, so I'm always staying up to date on the frontier of Ai.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a huge believer in the decentralization of big data. This goes right along with my optimism of decentralized social media. I am working on a blog post about those two things, so keep an eye out for it ;)

            Work
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm working under Dr. Jake Qualls at Astate doing research with the No Boundaries Thinking program, a collaboration with 7 out of 9 colleges on campus. Our thesis is to use a generative adversarial network (Ai model) to create the most comprehensible font for dyslexic readers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, we will be giving tests to dyslexic students to collect the data our model will use. My job is to build the website - frontend and backend - that this test will be taken on.
