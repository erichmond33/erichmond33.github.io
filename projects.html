                `Avant-Gardes: Rick Rolled
            </h2>
            <p>
                This was a NFT project I did back when the Bored Ape Yacht Club just came out. Feel free to check it out.

                `Tab Predictor
            </h2>
            <p>
                I thought it would be fun to build a basic model that predicts what tab you will open when you first open google chrome. In retrospect I should have used a different model structure, (RNN or transformer) and I only got the accuracy up to 60% on the test set.

                `Vex EDR Clawbot
            </h2>
            <p>
                I had to make a guide for the EDR Clawbot during my senior year in highschool. Not hard but pretty fun.

            <p>
                I got tired of writing code. I did this instead.

            <p>
                Just something I did to help out a close teacher of mine in highschool.
