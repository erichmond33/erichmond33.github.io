                This was my “hello world” project for crypto. It is a NFT collection based on the Rick Rolled meme, and truly one of the greatest NFT collections that never took off imo. Still I learned quite a bit about web3 and solidity which was my original goal anyway. I also wanted to see if I was really cut out for my high minded ambitions, so I was logging 10+ hour workdays. Ultimately I got this entire thing out the door in only a month all on my own.

                Feel free to check it out, but it will take a good 30 seconds to load at first since it is only running on free servers now.

            <p>
                This past summer I really wanted to build something “official”. I had pretty much reached the limit of what I could do with Ai given my limited compute power, and I had been doing some research into the crypto space. I thought the technology had potential, so I set out to build a website in order to truly learn these technologies, starting with this course.

            <p>
                I thought it would be fun to build a basic model that predicts what tab you will open when you first open google chrome. In retrospect I should have used a different model structure, (RNN or transformer) and I only got the accuracy up to 60% on the test set. I might revisit this in the future who knows.

                Since I was so impressed with Cs50x, I had high expectations here. There were a lot of great basic algorithmic concepts taught in this class, but not near enough deep learning stuff to advance my knowledge in that domain at this point.

            <p>
                Riding high I began my way deep into the depths of “deep learning”. I was already quite familiar with basic models from the books and previous Udemy course, but this specialization really dove fairly deep into the underlying math. While I did my best to soak it all up there are undoubtedly parts I won’t remember. Nonetheless, I got the chance to build some pretty neat stuff in this course.

            <p>
                My senior year in high school I worked on writing a guide to this Vex robot. It wasn’t hard to program, but I had to do it because I was “too advanced” for the basic coding class that I was supposed to be taking. This was actually really fun to see what I could make the robot do despite its trivial nature.

                <p>
                    Right about the time I completed Cs50x I was so burnt out from the difficulty of the course. I wanted to build something real and badass! The Boring Company’s “Not a Flamethrower” came to mind. Elon had said it wasn’t that hard to build, and he was right.

                This is where I took off. This course really opened my eyes to what coding actually was. I was fascinated and completely blown away. I fought long and hard to complete the course, and came out a better man for it. I just can’t explain how amazing this course was.

            <p>
                After I felt like I had a firm footing in programming, (which I didn’t) I was ready to tackle Ai. I took some an Udemy course, and I was struggling with basic setup of a programming project. I really just wasn’t proficient with computers at the time, and ultimately ended up quitting. While I didn’t do any of the projects, I did watch all of the videos and gained a very intuitive sense of the field.

                Four years ago I began to notice the amazing things Ai was capable of, and immediately I felt like the world was leaving me behind. In order to resolve some of my intense anxiety I decided it was time to learn just how this Ai stuff worked. However, first I had to learn to program!
