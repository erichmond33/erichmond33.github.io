<p>One day you are going to die; you'll be roughly 80 years old looking out over the world perhaps the countryside, city, or suburb, and everything you see, everything the light shines down on will be passed along to the next generation. Your children will inherit the world you helped leave behind, the world that is right in front of you.</p>
<p>Is it better, worse, or the same as when it was given to you? What value did you add to it? How has it changed? What have you given? What have you planted? Are you proud?</p>
<p>Maybe you made a lot of money. But doing what? Did it matter? More importantly, did it matter... to you? To your children?</p>

<p><strong>Interesting Blog Article 📃 <br></strong><a href="https://runyourown.social/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How to run a small social network site for your friends</a> by Darius Kazemi<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>After reading an <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/slow-social-media/" target="_blank">article</a> on slow social media which I have been a fan of for years now, I found my way to this post which I find very cool and interesting... TLDR; it is arguing in favor of tiny social network communities – kinda like these pickleball communities.</p>

<h3><strong>Grow Your Network</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Drake Weeks</strong><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_drakeweeks27/" target="_blank">instagram.com/_drakeweeks27/</a><br></p>
<p>Drake is a friend that goes way back. We've had periods where we were more and less in touch, but at least so far, we have never completely lost touch. Some of my best memories with him were fishing every day after football practice in the summer of 8th grade. In my opinion, Drake is sneakily ambitious. Currently his hustle is raising cattle which I personally find very interesting and am excited to see how it turns out. Regardless, I have no doubt he'll be very successful as long as he wants to be.</p></div>
