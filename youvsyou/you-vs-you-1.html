<p>As we get older, we realize the world is hard. We start to realize the value of a good person and how nice it is to have strong people in our lives to lean on when the going gets tough – the kind of people that don't break down or leave.</p>
<p>I don't know very many men that fit this description today. I'm not sure why more strong men don't exist, but I do know the world would be better if we had more of them.</p>
<p>Becoming virtuous, strong, competent men is our moral duty as human beings. It won't make you famous or rich, but it will come with a deep sense of fullness that can't be found any other way.</p>

<p>"All warfare is based on deception. [...] When we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near."</p>
