<p>During a meeting, the person who actually writes things down and distributes the plan is, by default, the one in charge regardless of their title or position.</p>
<p>The leader takes notes.</p>

<h3><strong>4 Cool Things</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Video on NOT Following Your Dreams ⭐️&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Rqf-vxBM8&amp;amp;ab_channel=HankGreen" target="_blank">Don't Follow Your Dreams, Follow Your Tools</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Sun-Tzu/dp/1599869772" rel="noopener" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>A unique framework for figuring out what to work on.</p>
<p><strong>Lecture on Being a Good Person and Bearing Your Oppression 🎧&nbsp;<br></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgZmDk1NcOU" target="_blank">Don't Be A Damn Victim</a>&nbsp;by Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>Jordan occasionally says some very smart things, and I think this is one of those.</p>
<p><strong>Cool Quote About Leonardo Da Vinci 📄&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/014312417X" target="_blank">Mastery</a>&nbsp;by Robert Greene<br><a href="https://x.com/jansramek/status/1945897306579939709?s=46" rel="noopener" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p><em>"This same force compelled him to steal paper from his father and devote his time to sketching. It pushed him to experiment while working for Verrocchio. It guided him away from the courts of Florence and the insecure egos that flourished among artists. It compelled him to an extreme of boldness—the gigantic sculptures, the attempt to fly, the dissection of hundreds of corpses for his anatomical studies—all to discover the essence of life itself."<br></em><em></em></p>
<p>This is super interesting for two reasons: (1) Leonardo was constantly making decisions that weren't optimal from a career perspective; (2) He was driven by a force Robert describes as discovering the essence of life itself which is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Great Book 📕&nbsp;</strong><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moveable-Feast-Restored-Ernest-Hemingway/dp/143918271X" target="_blank"><span>A Moveable Feast</span></a> by&nbsp;Ernest Hemingway<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2025/07/27/enough-ai-copilots-we-need-ai-huds.html" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>I've found this book very interesting because it is a look into his life during his 20s living in Paris as an up-and-coming writer. It is interesting to see him weighing similar decisions and experiences that my peers and I must consider: <em>"The one who is doing his work and getting satisfaction from it is not the one the poverty bothers."</em></p>
<p>It is also very rewarding to read about what life was like during this period (1910s-1920s) from a writer who obviously does a good job of painting a picture with words. On one hand it is interesting to consider what life is like when you have to heat your house with wood for example, but it is also fascinating to immerse in the culture and social norms of that period. As someone who feels modern culture is lacking, I'm always ready to consider another perspective.</p>

<h3><strong>Grow Your Network</strong></h3>
<p><strong>David Foster Wallace</strong><br><a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-5QEmE0fDs-david-foster-wallace-s-wraith" target="_blank">https://chatgpt.com/g/g-5QEmE0fDs-david-foster-wallace-s-wraith</a><br></p>
<p>This is a fun, quirky take on the growing your network section this week. David Foster Wallace is a highly respected writer who is no longer with us, but since so much of his brain was put onto paper, AI does a fairly good job of responding to chats as him.&nbsp;I created this ChatGPT version of him which you can talk to. Have fun with it :)</p></div>
