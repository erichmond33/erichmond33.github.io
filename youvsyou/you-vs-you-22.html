      <h3><strong>On Being Involved</strong></h3>
      <p>If you are curious what being involved looks like, here is an example from an email I recently sent:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><i><b><br></b></i></p>
      <p><i><b>Subject line: Spring Internship – Thoughts and Updates</b></i></p>
      <p><i><b><br></b></i></p>
      <p><i>Hello,</i></p>
      <p><i>First, I hope you had a fantastic Christmas! In this email, I wanted to share a few thoughts about my spring
          internship. Thank you again for this opportunity – I'm very grateful to be involved.</i></p>
      <p><i>As I might have mentioned, I'd like to build my career in defense technology and am eager to meet people in the
          field and gain as much industry exposure as possible. I understand that meaningful contribution in a company often
          goes beyond day-to-day tasks, and I'd welcome any opportunities to contribute more broadly. This could mean
          sitting in on important conversations to better understand the bigger picture, taking notes during meetings, or
          taking on additional tasks that support the company, even if they fall outside my core role. (As an example, about
          a month ago I noticed the American Droid website was a single static page without much information and thought I'd
          ask to help expand it since I enjoy that kind of work; although, I saw yesterday it's been updated significantly.)
          Simply put: I want to be as involved and helpful as possible.</i></p>
      <p><i>Regarding technical updates, I'll plan to provide weekly progress reports either via meeting or email, as I've
          done on past projects, unless you'd prefer a different approach. If possible, I'd also appreciate having the email
          addresses of the other engineers so I can stay in touch with their challenges and progress. (Who was working on
          the website?)</i></p>
      <p><i>Another thing, I understand your time at Booz Allen Hamilton gave you experience with the government contracting
          process (I think). I find this fascinating and would love to learn more about it, as it seems important to how
          defense tech companies operate. If you have any recommended books or online resources on this topic, I'd really
          appreciate it. If American Droid pursues another contract during my internship, maybe I could get some hands-on
          experience with that process?</i></p>
      <p><span
          style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, sans-serif;"><i>Thanks!</i></span>
      </p>
      <p><i>--<br>Eli Richmond</i></p>
      <p><i><br></i></p>
      <p>(And P.S., this internship is <i>unpaid</i>.)</p>

      <h3><strong>3 Cool Things</strong><strong></strong></h3>
      <p><b>Possibly the Best Book for Young Men 📕 </b><br><a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021">12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to
          Chaos</a> by Jordan Peterson</p>
      <p>I was going to include some awesome quotes from this book, but the thing is just so good all the way through. If
        you are a young man and haven't read this book, you should.</p>
      <p><b>Interesting Directory of Techy People 🤖 </b><br><a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a></p>
      <p>This is the site that inspired the <a href="https://warnav.com/people">Warnav Directory</a>. Basically it is a
        giant list of people that 1) Have a personal website and 2) Have a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">/now
          page</a> on that website. I've made quite a lot of friends here just by reaching out after a particular personal
        website was intriguing.</p>
      <p><b>Every Movie/TV Show Ever For Free 🍿<br></b><a href="goojara.to">goojara.to</a></p>
      <p>There are a lot of pirating sites like this, but this one seems to be the most reliable I've found in a while. Just
        make sure you have an adequate ad blocker installed.</p>
