        <h3><strong>On Modern Architecture...</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Why is every building so bland and ugly these days? Every city looks
          exactly the same. Architecture used to be so beautiful and ornate.
          This is such an interesting phenomena, and I think there is a great
          answer but an even more important byproduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buildings are the way they are because mid-20th century zoning codes
          locked in modernist design principles, but these regulations make
          alternative building styles difficult or illegal to construct.
          However, modernism succeeded brilliantly at creating buildings that
          are dramatically safer and more efficient than before – solving the
          problem of disease ridden slums and post-war housing shortages.
          Efficiency comes with a cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern architecture is built by no one for no one. Buildings don't
          welcome you or offer any spectacle. Most American cities look
          identical and encourage everyone not to have any vested interest in
          them. They don't want you care. And if you don't care about anything,
          you'll be much easier to enslave. Who is "They" you ask? "They" might
          be specific power hungry people. "They" might be the natural forces of
          chaos humans have been struggling with since forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life has many such problems like this architecture situation. Nobody
          is quite sure why it is happening. It's kinda good but also kinda not
          so great and sad. It would be a monumental task to try and fix as a
          single individual. Yet despite these rigid systems, everything is
          always seemingly on the brink of collapse. The only answer is to Care
          – Care with a capital "C". Care like your life and your children's
          lives depend on it because, although we may forget it, they do.

          <strong>Google Chrome Sucks – Use This Instead 🦁&nbsp;<br /></strong

          As a tech guy, I use the internet A LOT, so being able to navigate the
          internet effectively is a priority. Google Chrome used to be good, but
          now with the introduction of manifest v3, ad blockers –&nbsp;<em
            >an absolute necessity&nbsp;</em
          >– don't work very well. I've tried out many search engines and Brave
          Browser is my new favorite, and&nbsp;<strong
            >I implore you&nbsp;</strong
          >to switch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The switch is super easy, and all of your bookmarks, extensions, and
          everything will be ported in a single click. It has a built in ad
          blocker (still add

        <p>
          A great question to ask at the end of an interview is one that shows
          you want to succeed in the role. Two examples:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px">
          <em
            >“This program sounds both challenging and rewarding—can you share
            an example of a past participant who really excelled, and what set
            them apart?”</em

        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px">
          <em
            >"Let's say I get the job, and we are looking back a year from now.
            What will I have had to have done for this to have been a
            success?"</em

          Jack is a forensic anthropology grad student here at ECU who I've had
          the pleasure to meet through our involvement in club pickleball. He is
          a good dude and very passionate about his work (apparently ECU has a
          very strong <meta charset="utf-8" />anthropology department which is
          why he is here). Give him a shout!<br /><br />P.S. Find more awesome
