          <h3><strong>On Stealing...</strong></h3>
<p>You might have heard the saying: "Good artists copy; Great artists steal." Here is a fun example of that...</p>
<p>My personal website (<a rel="noopener" href="https://elir.net" target="_blank">https://elir.net</a>) was first created by literally stealing the style code from Derek Siver's personal website (<a rel="noopener" href="https://sive.rs" target="_blank">https://sive.rs</a>), and for a long time, I was a little bit ashamed of this even though I made many changes to make it my own.</p>
<p>Years go by and now, understanding a little bit more about Derek as well as doing some digging on the internet, there is strong evidence his design is stolen from a combination of these two personal websites!!! <a rel="noopener" href="https://dhh.dk/" target="_blank">https://dhh.dk/</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.timferriss.com/" target="_blank">http://www.timferriss.com/</a></p>
<p>Don't be afraid nor ashamed to steal. It's how things are made.</p>

<p>My little brother and I made a few Youtube videos awhile back. This one was by far my favorite despite it not doing very well. The plot is a cinematic masterpiece lol.</p>

The best part is free access to Perplexity's Comet: an AI web browser agent.

<p>This is my latest project – a private server meant to connect all the ambitious men I meet. <meta charset="utf-8">The not-so-sophisticated sales pitch is: join this if you want to get rich. If you are happy with how your life is now, this isn't for you, but if you'd like to be in a digital room with other people that want more from life, this probably is for you.<br><br><em>To join you'll need a private link... just shoot me a message if you want to be one of the very first people to get an account.</em></p>
