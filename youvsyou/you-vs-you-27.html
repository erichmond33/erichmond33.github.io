      <h3><strong>On Resumes</strong></h3>
      <p>Crafting a good resume is fundamentally a marketing task, but what does that actually mean? If you are in marketing
        or sales you probably already know, but as a STEM student – science, tech, engineering, math – we are trained to
        write as clearly and accurately as possible which makes for terrible marketing material.</p>
      <p>You know when you see an ad, and you are like, mmm that ad is probably not super true and the promises are a bit
        over the top for what it could realistically deliver? If your resume doesn't kinda feel like that, you probably
        aren't pushing hard enough in the marketing direction. Nothing should be blatantly untrue of course, but it should
        sound and feel a little more grand than it probably felt to you day-to-day.</p>

      <h3><strong>3 Cool Things</strong></h3>
      <p><b>New Ergonomic Keyboard I'm Excited About ⌨️<br></b><a
          href="https://read.compose.llc/p/our-keyboard-design-reveal">Compose Keyboard</a> by Ryan Peterman</p>
      <p>Ryan talks about many of the problems all the modern ergonomic keyboards have, and I too agree that I ran into
        these same problems when looking for a good split keyboard. Their product is basically an Apple keyboard chopped in
        half and made really portable. It's perfect for me, and I can't wait to see them make it a reality.</p>
      <p><b>Better TextEdit for Mac 📝 <br></b><a href="https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit">MarkEdit</a></p>
      <p>I use Mac's default text editor (TextEdit) a lot. It's what I use to write in my always-open journal and my always-open scratchpad/to-do list – both accessible instantly via keyboard shortcuts. Since I updated my OS to Tahoe,
        TextEdit has had some bugs that don't seem to be going away. MarkEdit is a similar but arguably better alternative.

      <p><b>San Antonio, TX Has Shockingly Affordable Housing 🏠</b><br><a
          href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/?searchQueryState=%7B%22isMapVisible%22%3Atrue%2C%22mapBounds%22%3A%7B%22west%22%3A-98.70830283178712%2C%22east%22%3A-98.24481711401368%2C%22south%22%3A29.216349259174503%2C%22north%22%3A29.536169150812142%7D%2C%22filterState%22%3A%7B%22sort%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3A%22globalrelevanceex%22%7D%2C%22price%22%3A%7B%22min%22%3A150000%2C%22max%22%3A250000%7D%2C%22mp%22%3A%7B%22min%22%3A750%2C%22max%22%3A1250%7D%7D%2C%22isListVisible%22%3Atrue%2C%22pagination%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22usersSearchTerm%22%3A%22%22%2C%22mapZoom%22%3A12%7D">Zillow
          Listings 150k-250k</a></p>
      <p>Why do I care about this/why should you? Well, as an ambitious person, there is more opportunity in bigger cities,
        so I've always been curious about the cost and living situations of these larger cities (larger meaning around a
        population of 1 million). I've personally looked in-depth or spent some time in Austin, San Francisco, Raleigh, and
        Los Angeles. My conclusion was, if I wanted to own a home in a larger city, it'll cost $400,000 or more – nearly
        impossible. Bummer. I was surprised to see San Antonio was so affordable; however, there doesn't seem to be much
        business activity compared to the other cities I listed which might explain it. Interesting nonetheless.</p>

      <p>This is the CEO of <a href="https://evoracompany.com">Evora</a>, a small digital watch brand that I got as a gift for a few
        of my friends back during Christmas. I don't know him personally; I reached out over LinkedIn with some questions
        about the product before I bought. It's cool we live in an age where you can contact just about anyone over the
        internet – especially the founders of cool companies.</p>
