        <h1>Beyond Pure Reps, RSS Revival, Dana White's Journey, and More</h1>
        <h3><b>On Reps, Reps, Reps...</b></h3>
        <p>Every metric of measurable success is in your control. We can all brute force our way into measurable success
          without being talented or smart through reps, reps, reps. It is not easy but shockingly simple. If all you want from
          life is an abundance of money, status, nice cars, etc... just do more reps. Simple.</p>

        <p>How did we invent the airplane? And if you wanted to invent the next great thing, how would you actually do it?</p>
        <p>This book is one of my all-time favorites. It pushes back against the “reps, reps, reps,” goal-obsessed,
          hyper-structured approach so common in American achievement culture. I recommend it especially for Type-A
          overachievers or anyone who wants to accomplish something truly meaningful.</p>
        <p>My biggest takeaway: be more open-minded and less judgmental. We don’t know—and can’t know—which paths will lead to
          breakthroughs. It’s arrogant to assume we do.</p>
        <p><b>The Best Way To Consume Online Content (RSS) 📱&nbsp;</b><br><a

        <p>There is a great chance you have absolutely no idea what RSS is or why you should care. It's an old, open
          technology that nobody owns which is why it isn't a sticky system you can't get away from (like social media). If
          this peaks your interest, I'd also compliment the article with this one too:&nbsp;<a

        <p><b>Good New Movie 🎞️&nbsp;</b><br>

        <p>I found this movie pretty captivating because it is about a man trying to provide for his family when his skillset
          doesn't fit into the modern world. The protagonist is a complex character and anti-hero. I give it a 9/10.</p>

          <strong>Dana White (CEO of UFC)</strong><br><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White">wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White</a>
        </p>
        <p>No I don't know Dana White obviously, but I really find his career path very interesting because it was so
          non-opportunistic. There was no jumping on some new technology wave or striking fast during some metaphorical gold
          rush opportunity. Dana loved the fight business and embedded himself in that industry for decades.</p>
        <p>The timeline is a bit messy based on the wiki page, but he wanted to be a boxer, then worked as a coach, opened his
          own boxing gym, was a manager for UFC fighters, and created the deal that ended up with him as president of the UFC.
          I encourage you to read through his wikipedia page which is a mini-biography of his life.</p>
