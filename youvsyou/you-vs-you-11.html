          <h3><strong>On Independence...</strong></h3>
<p>The ultimate form of power is not independence. The completely independent man would live alone in the woods... He would have freedom but not power.</p>
<p>Power involves a relationship between people; we will always need others as allies, etc.</p>
<p>If you admire the idea of living alone in the woods, free and independent, answer this: How did that work out for the Native Americans?</p>

<strong>3 Cool Things</strong><strong></strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>Beautiful Stoneware Mugs ☕️ <br></strong><a rel="noopener" href="https://cherricopottery.com/shop-everyday-use-affordable-pottery/?page=1" target="_blank">Cherrico Pottery</a><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>I really hate boring ceramic mugs. As a coffee drinker, I have to hold my mug at least once a day, so it is nice to hold something that makes me happy – in this case, a beautiful piece of art made by Joel Cherrico.</p>
<p><strong>Fun Board Game 🎲<br></strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan" target="_blank">Catan</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Bwxv8ehLlIM" rel="noopener" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>Yesterday I played this for the first time after having many people recommend it to me. It is a 10/10 and super fun, with similar amount of complexity as Monopoly but a little more strategic.</p>
<p><strong>Funny Videos 🎞️ <br></strong><a href="https://rumble.com/c/tateconfidential/videos?e9s=src_v1_cbl" target="_blank">Tate Confidential</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Bwxv8ehLlIM" rel="noopener" target="_blank"></a></p>
<div class="style-scope ytd-video-description-header-renderer" id="factoids"></div>
<p>You know Andrew Tate? Well I recently discovered he makes vlogs on Rumble (I guess he is too outlandish for Youtube lol). I'm by no means a fan of Andrew Tate, but his character makes for some really funny content imo.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Stinnett</strong><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theunstuckcoach/" target="_blank">linkedin.com/in/theunstuckcoach/</a><br></p>
<p>Mike is a career development coach with 17,000 followers on LinkedIn. Additionally, he was my English Teacher in the 8th grade and one of the first ones to ever really make me think critically about the world not because of some clever assignment, but rather because of his character and values on a day-to-day basis. He is an inspiration to me and many people I know. He'd absolutely love if you reached out.</p></div>
