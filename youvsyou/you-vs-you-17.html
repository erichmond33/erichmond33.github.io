        <h1>Creative Profit Models, Why Work?, Keyboard Shortcuts For the Web, and More</h1>
        <h3><b>On Work...</b></h3><p>Every institution, company, and government on the planet is – and has always been – on the brink of collapse at any moment. They are all held together by small groups of very passionate people. The default state of the world is chaos and tyranny, and it is our job to fend that off. Put another way, the reason we work is NOT primarily to feed our families. The reason we work is to keep the world functioning and (ideally) improving.</p><p>We teach children the reason they are slaving away in the food service industry or some other menial, minimum wage job is to learn about work ethic to eventually one day go into crippling debt for an education they can't use, rent their home from a bank, get married (and eventually divorced), get burned by the legal system, and wake up day after day more bored and more beat down than the last. It's no wonder why they are "lazy"! They either want to work and spend very little or get rich by dropshipping junk with both routes essentially contributing nothing to their fellow man for most of their lives. That's individualism? That's American freedom?</p><p>If we taught them that they weren't meant to wait tables... if we taught them that their purpose was to achieve to their absolute fullest capability because the world is hard and sucks and constantly on the brink of collapse, then maybe they'd be more willing to sacrifice and serve with the most competence and virtue that they can muster over a long, beautiful 80-year lifespan. And if they strive to achieve great things they'll realize just how hard it is! They'll come to grips with their own vices and shortcomings and appreciate whatever small contribution to the world they can handle and the support of a family and institutions. They'll start to realize just how damn incredible it is that, oh my god look around... the lights are on and everything just works! It's a miracle.</p><p>Work isn't about money or providing or achievement. Work is about not being an absolute useless turd and becoming as useful as you possibly can be. Constantly grow and continue to take on more and more responsibility across all the important areas of life: family, friends, career, and community. Do this and you'll provide, make money, and achieve great things along the way.</p>

        <p>I only recently met Caio at an ECU grad student event. We've since hit it off as he is a guy that likes to do a lot yet is also very serious about his career path. After graduating he aims to be a Medical Physicist. Very cool guy.</p><p>An aside... during my undergrad I thought the only people going to events hosted by Astate were lonely, uncool people, yet this couldn't be further from the truth. People that go to events are often the personalities that are very invested in their community and are outgoing, cool people. Do more stuff.</p><p>P.S. Find more awesome
