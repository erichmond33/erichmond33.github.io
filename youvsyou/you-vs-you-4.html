<p><strong>A Ridiculous ChatGPT Chart 📊 <br></strong><a href="https://x.com/connerdelights/status/1953503460768592236" target="_blank">Chart From OpenAI's GPT-5 Demo</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Sun-Tzu/dp/1599869772" rel="noopener" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>OpenAI released bar graphs about GPT-5's performance which were absolutely dumb and deceptive. You'll get a good laugh. It seems AI progress is slowing until we have another major architecture breakthrough which could be one month away or one decade away – nobody knows.</p>

<p>This video uses real statistics to paint a fairly pessimistic view on the future. I've got an article coming out soon that argues against this; nonetheless, this is interesting and informative.</p>

His most popular book, <a rel="noopener" href="https://blackirishbooks.com/product/the-war-of-art/" target="_blank">The War of Art</a>, is an enjoyable and helpful read for anyone pursuing anything creative. He has a really crazy life story about becoming a writer. Much like Derek Sivers last week, he is a guy who isn't seeking out your attention which feels like a breath of fresh air in this day and age.</p></div>
