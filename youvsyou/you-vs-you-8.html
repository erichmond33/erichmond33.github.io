        <div class="content"><h3><strong>On Morals...</strong></h3>
<p>Character should be your number one priority when choosing friends.<br></p>
<p>As men and leaders, we ought to have very rigid moral values about what is and what is not okay (if we don't have them nobody will), and the people we call friends should absolutely share these.</p>
<p>People that don't share our moral values should be treated with love and respect yet be ideally avoided as long as it isn't rude. And always be humbly aware of your own human and moral imperfections.</p>

<h3><strong>3 Cool Things (From You)</strong></h3>
<p><em>(I asked a few of my close friends subscribed to this newsletter to submit something for this section; it turned out surprisingly, coincidentally... animal themed 😂)</em></p>
<p><strong>Octopus Fun Fact 🐙</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Rqf-vxBM8&amp;amp;ab_channel=HankGreen" target="_blank"></a><em>Octopuses have three hearts, and two of them stop beating when they swim.</em><br><br>I never found the Octopus to be that interesting until I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s0LTDhqe5A&amp;ab_channel=Netflix">My Octopus Teacher</a>. They are really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Peregrine Falcon -&gt; Stealth Bomber 💣 <br></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=agePF5Lpcks&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=Sciborg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why is the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber Shaped Like a Peregrine Falcon?</a><strong><br><br></strong>Pretty cool to see us replicate nature through engineering.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rhinos Get Radioactive 🦏<br></strong><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/01/nx-s1-5488737/scientists-south-africa-rhino-horns-radioactive-poaching" target="_blank">Scientists in South Africa are making rhino horns radioactive to fight poaching</a><strong><br></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgZmDk1NcOU" target="_blank"></a><strong></strong></p>
<p>Apparently this is a thing?</p>
<p><strong>Crows Don't Exist 🐦<br><br></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Rqf-vxBM8&amp;amp;ab_channel=HankGreen" target="_blank"></a><strong></strong><strong></strong><em>"For a full 6 months before my ex broke up with me, he tried to gaslight me into believing crows don't exist. Like I'd send a Snapchat of a crow, and he would tell me they don't exist and I'd be like but there is a picture of one? And he'd say I must have used AI or something because crows don't exist." </em>– Some girl I was talking to recently<em></em></p>

<h3><strong>Grow Your Network</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Tyler Privett</strong><br><a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-5QEmE0fDs-david-foster-wallace-s-wraith" target="_blank"></a>870-275-1218 or typrivett29@gmail.com<br></p>
<p>This a long-time friend I've known since the 5th grade where he would dominate recess football with one hand while the other held a bag of Cheez-its. There aren't many other people I know that are as naturally athletically gifted as Tyler. He really is a good guy these days – and I mean that genuinely, not just as a nicety. It'll be very exciting to see where his career ends up as he is capable of doing whatever he wants to do. Currently, he is actively trying to meet new people so call or email!</p></div>
