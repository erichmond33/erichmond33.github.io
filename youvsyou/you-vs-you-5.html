<p>I'm leaving for North Carolina to attend grad school at ECU this Tuesday, and I'll be gone for a year (besides holidays) at least.</p>
<p>While I'm excited, I'm also going to stay in touch and encourage you to reach out as well.<br></p>
<p>(In fact, I'd be ecstatic to share the systems I use to stay connected to people which has been one of the most important chores throughout my life.)<br><br><em>"If you're bored, send a letter." – </em>Chad Foster in <a href="https://www.chadfoster.com/tprw-home.html" target="_blank">Teenagers-Preparing for the Real World</a><br></p>

<p>If you consider yourself to be an above-average rational person, it is your duty to be decisive.</p>
<p>Often leadership is knowing what is best and simply speaking up when presented with options.</p>
<p>Avoid being indifferent or suffer the consequences of someone else's irrationality. </p>
