<p>We don't go to work to pay bills. <meta charset="utf-8">We don't work to provide for our families. We don't go to work to get rich and have unlimited personal freedom.</p>
<p>We work to become the best possible version of ourselves... the version that doesn't have to think about bills, the version who our friends and family come to in order solve problems, the version who is rich because we are strong enough and smart enough to keep the world functioning.</p>
<p>We work to keep the world from collapsing, and we should take on as much responsibility and risk as we can bear.</p>
