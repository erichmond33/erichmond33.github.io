      <h1>Dealing with HR, Great Shoes, Book About Maintenance?, and More</h1>
      <h3><strong>On HR</strong></h3>
      <p>In the corporate world we all will eventually encounter the HR-type, and by that I mean the person whose job is to
        keep everyone safe by slowing everything down with rules and regulations, many of which will seem silly and
        unnecessary. Here is my advice on dealing with this.</p>
      <p>I've seen many people have the gut instinct to get upset and fight with the HR-types about what situation they are
        in, or perhaps, submit to the rules but talk about how dumb and awful they are when this person is not around and
        generally be upset about the impeded progress. This is not what we should do.</p>
      <p>Instead we should treat these people with the utmost, over-the-top kindness and respect for they have the power to
        make your life miserable. In my experience doing so, there are often loopholes they can present to you but certainly
        wouldn't if you are not treating them very well. Make the HR-type your closest friend if you want your life to be
        easier.</p>
      <p>And sure, if the rule truly doesn't need to exist, feel free to try and change things, but how you go about it can
        make all the difference.</p>

      <h3><strong>3 Cool Things</strong></h3>
      <p><b>Great Book About Maintenance? Who Knew 🤔<br></b><a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Maintenance-Everything-Part-One/dp/1953953492">Maintenance of Everything: Part
          One</a> by Stewart Brand</p>
      <p>The books that have really enthralled me over the years are the ones you don't see coming. I was not expecting to
        enjoy this as much as I have been. For the techie folks out there, Stewart Brand published the Whole Earth Catalog
        in the 70s. The entrepreneur/innovator type tends to shun maintenance as this annoying thing forever in the way of
        their next brilliant creation, but this book will give you a different perspective.</p>
      <p><b>Really Good Shoes 👟 <br></b><a href="https://nobullproject.com/products/mens-black-gum-outwork-edge">NoBull
          Outwork Edge</a></p>
      <p>I believe a great shoe is extremely durable and extremely versatile. Most shoes are only good at one thing. These
        are the closest shoes I've found to being good at everything – the only thing I'd be hesitant to do is run any kind
        of long-distance in them. Mine have held up really good over the past year.</p>
      <p><b>Nice Tweet 🐦</b><br>Robert Greene:</p>
      <blockquote><i>"Think as you like but behave like others.<br></i><i>If you make a show of going against the times,
          flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that
          you look down upon them.<br></i><i>They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior.<br></i><i>It
          is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch.<br></i><i>Share your originality only with tolerant friends
          and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness."</i></blockquote>
      <p>If you're a young man full of energy, ambition, passion, and somewhat of a lack of appreciation for orthodox rules,
        this is good advice. It'll save you some headache and ostracism.</p>

      <p><b>Shawn Askinosie<br></b><a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Meaningful-Work-Quest-Business-Calling/dp/0143130315/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513033680&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=meaningful+work">Meaningful
          Work: A Quest to Do Great Business, Find Your Calling, and Feed Your Soul</a></p>
      <p>This is the CEO of Askinosie Chocolate out of Springfield, MO. Many months ago I emailed him after reading his book
        ^ just to tell him I really enjoyed it. That turned into a few delightful email conversations. Cool guy; great book.
