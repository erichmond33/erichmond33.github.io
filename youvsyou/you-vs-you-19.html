        <h1>Great John Cena Podcast, Feminization in the Workplace, Underrated Power of Gratitude, and More</h1>
        <h3><b>On Gratitude...</b></h3>
        <p>Gratitude is one of the most underrated virtues in both its value from a zoomed-out mindset or outlook
          perspective and from a pragmatic zoomed-in
            day-to-day emotional grounding perspective.
            Being grateful from the zoomed-out view encourages us to take the opportunities we are given, no matter how
            big or how small, very seriously and treat them with care and effort. Being grateful from the zoomed-in
            perspective is fantastic for bringing about peace and happiness within ourselves emotionally right now – it
            is hard to be both genuinely grateful for every little thing in your life and be upset at the same time. Try
            it now?</p>

        <h3><strong>3 Cool Things</strong></h3>
        <p><b>Fantastic Podcast Episode About Gratitude 🎧<br></b>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ4Ho4ccuFg" class="link">Joe Rogan Experience #2423 - John Cena</a>
        </p>
        <p>Continuing on the theme of gratitude, John Cena is surprisingly one of the most virtuous, respectable men on
          the planet. His outlook on life can be summarized as 1) I just want to be involved 2) I'm incredibly lucky to
          be here 3) Thus, I'm going to give it everything I've got. This is in opposition to setting some big goal – he
          just wants to be involved, work hard, and the cards will fall as they may.</p>
        <p><b>Article on Understanding Feminization in the Workplace 💼 </b><br><a
            href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-great-feminization/">The Great Feminization</a> by Helen
          Andrews</p>
        <p><i>This read caught me off guard with how important and spot-on it is.</i> I found it useful for two reasons.
          One, women approach conflict and competition wayyy different then men do: "In short, men wage conflict openly
          while women covertly undermine or ostracize their enemies." This is a big deal. Two, for me at least, this
          overall feminization explains why a lot of office jobs feel so sad...? The feminized office feels very...
          sterile? It feels to me that feminized work
            culture prizes looking productive and avoiding friction more than pursuing deep, difficult, meaningful
            outcomes. The target feels slightly misaligned from what makes work feel purposeful.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Just a quick 1-minute reminder that the internet and social media is not your friend: "Do you ever notice
          that devices and screens are usually in your dreams? There's something about the digital realm that doesn't
          quite stick in your memory the way physical experiences do." Go make some memories.</p>

        <p>This is the director of graduate studies for computer science at ECU, my research mentor during my summer
          program a few years ago, and kind of the entire reason I'm enrolled here at ECU at all really. I'm not sure
          how beneficial it would be to contact him (although I don't think he'd be bothered by an introduction email),
          but it may become beneficial to know of him one day down the line. He's probably my closest contact at the
          college.</p>
