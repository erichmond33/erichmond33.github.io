        <div class="content"><h3><strong>On People...</strong></h3>
<p>Often, life is good, and often, the byproduct of not encountering hateful, rotten people for a long period of time is the importance of fundamental being-a-good-person-ness gets somewhat forgotten.</p>
<p>However, when life eventually puts those kind of people in the same room as us, it becomes abundantly clear that these fundamentals are absolutely, concretely non-negotiable for life to not be miserably, awfully, and unnecessarily hard.</p>
<p>Be a good person and cherish the peaceful times for one day you will be face-to-face with a huge turd of a human being.</p>

<p><strong>I'm So Grateful ✍️ <br><br></strong>Because of forces larger than me, I find myself in a wonderful position in life – it is only temporary as all things are, but I am not lost on how nice I have it right now. I encourage you to look around, set aside any of the endless problems we all have, and take note of everything. I, for one, am extremely grateful and say it everyday.<br><em></em></p>
