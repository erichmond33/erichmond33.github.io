      <h1>Great Gifts, Staying Warm, AI Mentors, and More</h1>
      <h3><strong>On Peace</strong></h3>
      <p>There is a quote I'm sure you've read somewhere: <i>"To sit with a dog on a hillside on a glorious afternoon is to
          be back in Eden, where doing nothing was not boring - it was peace." </i>I've never emotionally understood this
        growing up; logically, sure, I get it, but I've always felt like that would get boring pretty quick and I'd want to
        do something else after maybe 15 minutes or so. For me, it was only after dealing with bad people and the awful
        situations they create that I really I understood why someone might want to sit on a hillside with a dog for a bit
        and why that is so peaceful. As the holidays arrive, enjoy the brief periods of time where there aren't any fires to
        put out.</p>

      <h3><strong>3 Cool Things</strong><strong></strong></h3>
      <p><b>Pottery is a Great Gift ☕️&nbsp;</b><br><a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/mara-stoneware/s?k=mara+stoneware&amp;adgrpid=185328981264&amp;hvadid=748008564600&amp;hvcampaign=dsadesk&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvexpln=m-dsad&amp;hvlocphy=1021130&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvocijid=17774995797095853851--&amp;hvrand=17774995797095853851&amp;hvsb=SportingGoods_d&amp;hvtargid=dsa-1599025204921&amp;tag=googhydr-20">Mara
            Stoneware ($)</a> or <a href="https://cherricopottery.com/shop-pottery/">Cherrico Pottery ($$)</a></p>
      <p>1) Everyone drinks coffee. 2) Everyone uses cheap, ceramic mugs. Thus, a premium stoneware mug has historically
        worked out great as gifts. Mara Stoneware is nice, has some unique designs, but isn't too expensive. If you want to
        splurge, Joel Cherrico makes some really interesting stuff; although, typically I can't afford it unless it is on
        sale.</p>
      <p><b>Must Have Clothing Item During the Winter ❄️&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br><a
          href="https://www.nike.com/t/pro-warm-mens-tights-j90CwW/FB7961-100">Leggings</a>&nbsp;(Any Brand Though)</p>
      <p>Just hear me out... this is so underrated, but I don't know of any other guys that do this. I wear fairly thick
        leggings (old Nike ones from high school football if you're curious) under my jeans and sweats during the cold
        months – it provides seriously next level warmth. Give it a shot.</p>
      <p><b>Interactive Conversations With 12 Legendary Mentors&nbsp;👔&nbsp;<br></b><a

      <p>I made some cool Claude artifacts that walk you through problems based on a particular persona. The mentors I've
        included are:&nbsp;Jordan Peterson, Tim Ferriss, Marcus Aurelius, Seth Godin, Mark Manson, Steven Pressfield, Alex
        Hormozi, Rick Rubin, Sun Tzu, Robert Kiyosaki, Derek Sivers, and David Foster Wallace.</p>

      <p>This is an old friend from the ECU research fellowship I did a few summers ago. He is super energetic and always
        ready to do things (a common trait I seem to really enjoy in friends). He is currently a&nbsp;<span>FedEx Cloud
          Platform Engineer and getting married soon! He would be absolutely ecstatic to meet new people if you want to say
          hello.</span></p>
