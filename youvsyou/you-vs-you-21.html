      <h3><strong>On Character</strong></h3>
      <div><i>Character compounds through perception.</i></div>
      <p>I recently received praise for what was actually a mundane action – going upstairs to get water. Because someone
        had observed respectful behavior from me over time, they attributed extra thoughtfulness to something quite
        ordinary.</p>
      <p>This reveals something interesting: once your character crosses a certain threshold in either direction, people
        interpret your actions through that lens. Build a positive reputation, and even your neutral behaviors get generous
        interpretations. Build a negative one, and people assume the worst about identical actions.</p>
      <p>Character is cumulative. Small, consistent choices create the framework through which others interpret everything
        you do.</p>

      <h3><strong>3 Cool Things</strong><strong></strong></h3>
      <p><b>Possibly the Best Book for Young Men 📕 </b><br><a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021">12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to
          Chaos</a> by Jordan Peterson</p>
      <p>I was going to include some awesome quotes from this book, but the thing is just so good all the way through. If
        you are a young man and haven't read this book, you should.</p>
      <p><b>Interesting Directory of Techy People 🤖 </b><br><a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a></p>
      <p>This is the site that inspired the <a href="https://warnav.com/people">Warnav Directory</a>. Basically it is a
        giant list of people that 1) Have a personal website and 2) Have a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">/now
          page</a> on that website. I've made quite a lot of friends here just by reaching out after a particular personal
        website was intriguing.</p>
      <p><b>Every Movie/TV Show Ever For Free 🍿<br></b><a href="https://goojara.to">goojara.to</a></p>
      <p>There are a lot of pirating sites like this, but this one seems to be the most reliable I've found in a while. Just
        make sure you have an adequate ad blocker installed.</p>
