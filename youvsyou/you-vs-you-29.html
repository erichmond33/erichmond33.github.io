      <h3><strong>3 Cool Things</strong></h3>
      <p><b>Great Book I've Internalized 📕 <br></b><a href="https://sive.rs/u">Useful Not True</a> by Derek Sivers</p>
      <p>This is such a great book on some of the core ideas Derek constantly writes about. It wasn't as impactful when I first
        read it because I've read hundreds of Derek's blog posts on similar topics. A great first chapter to check out is:
        <a href="https://sive.rs/u13">Memories are not accurate.</a></p>
      <p><b>Strange Podcast Duo But Great Clip 👨‍🎓 <br></b><a
          href="https://x.com/Sneak0o/status/2022881917725462620">Sneako with <span>Professor Jiang from Predictive
            History</span></a></p>
      <p>The main reason I'm sharing this is the last line: "Your true wealth is in the knowledge that you've accumulated
        and in your influence and connections you've made." This as opposed to believing your wealth is tied to the amount
        of money you have which is a made-up social construct – this is part of a broader theme in my life right now
        realizing that stability doesn't really exist.</p>
      <p><b>Nice Quote From Jordan Peterson </b><br></p>
      <p><i>"In your call to action, you might not get what you want, but you'll find what you need"</i></p>
