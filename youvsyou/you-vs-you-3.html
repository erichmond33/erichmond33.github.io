<p>Don't fall into the trap of constantly looking for perfect answers to questions that don't have them.</p>
<p>As much as I love and rely on Google and ChatGPT and all of this "amazing" technology, the most important and challenging problems we will face as human beings can't be Googled nor can you think your way through them.</p>
<p>Our only course of action is action – to do all that we can and trust in something that things will work out or at least that we'll have the strength to deal with whatever does happen.</p>

<p>Derek has been a musician, entrepreneur, and writer with the majority of his fame coming from the sale of his internet company, CD Baby, for $22 million.
