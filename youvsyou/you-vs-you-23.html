      <h1>Great TV Show, Post-college Career Path Option, Modern-day Rolodex, and More</h1>
      <h3><strong>On Promotions</strong></h3>
      <p>The four most important traits that will further your career:</p>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Extroverted</li>
        <li>Enthusiastic</li>
        <li>Energetic</li>
        <li>Candid</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
      <p>Almost nobody is born with all four. It is <i>work </i>to bring these with you into your day-to-day life. That's
        okay. These matter just as much as your ability to do your job – perhaps more.</p>

      <h3><strong>3 Cool Things</strong><strong></strong></h3>
      <p><b>Awesome TV Show for Creative People 📺 </b><br><a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/show/VLPLRWvNQVqAeWKt7kCUfEMdJi40m7H58CJd?sbp=KgtORTN1T1ZWakI5OEAB">Taskmaster</a>
        by Alex Horne</p>
      <p>This is the single greatest show I've found in the past five years. It's unlike anything else I've ever watched, so
        I can't compare it to anything. Just. Watch. It.</p>
      <p>P.S. It's free on Youtube.</p>
      <p>P.P.S. Season 19 is by far the best season.</p>
      <p><b>Consider Joining the Army/Navy/Air Force Etc After College 🧑‍🎓 </b><br><a
          href="https://www.navy.com/careers-benefits/careers">Navy Careers</a></p>
      <p>Hear me out... A lot of my peers have already, or will soon, graduate from college and still have no idea what to
        do with their degree or won't find work within their field. This is a potential solution you might consider that's
        much less competitive.</p>
      <p>So the normal route into the Army/Navy/Air Force is to be enlist which means sign a four-year contract to go into
        some field. But if you have a college degree, you can go straight into an officer position which has better pay and
        can be in a specific field related to your degree. (If you click the Navy link above, filter by officer positions –
        it'll make things a bit more digestible and less overwhelming.) The biggest downside is your contract will be eight
        years, but outside of that, it honestly seems like a pretty decent gig.</p>
      <p><b>Modern-day Rolodex 📄 </b><br></p>
      <p>Before computers existed, every successful person had a Rolodex with a bunch of names and phone numbers in it, and
        more importantly, they put them to use staying in touch with people and jotting down key information. With
        modern-day phones and laptops, you don't really have to put forth much effort to keep contacts, and thus, the
        importance of using those contacts has also subsided.</p>
      <p>I have my own solution to this. I keep my own database with all my contacts along with some extra information
        accessible and update-able via my computer. This comes with some simple keyboard shortcuts I've made that can show
        me upcoming birthdays, people I haven't contacted in a while, people from a certain location, etc. Essentially, a
        modern-day Rolodex in that it isn't just for storing phone numbers rather keeping in touch with people.</p>
      <p>If this is interesting to you, let me know. I'll show you how mine works. I've been thinking about polishing it up
        into a shareable piece of software, but I'm not sure if anyone would care.</p>

      <h3><strong>Grow Your Network</strong></h3>

        <strong>Stephen Ward</strong><br><a
          href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-ward-70845122b/">linkedin.com/in/stephen-ward-70845122b</a>
      </p>
      <p>Stephen goes to ECU and recently decided to officially become a Cyber Officer for the Army. I had questions about
        this career path, and if you do as well, tell him I sent you and he'd be happy to answer any questions you might
        have.</p>
      <p>(An example of using my modern-day Rolodex... As I was writing this, I realized I hadn't added Stephen to my
        database yet, so I added him. I don't have any plans or reasons I can think of as to why I might need to contact him
        in the future, but life is crazy. Recently, staying in contact with a colleague despite meeting her initially like
        three years ago finally paid off through her offering me an important position. I never could have predicted that.)
