      <h1>Copy & Paste Tool, a16z Raises $15 Billion, and Life Is Like High School</h1>
      <h3><strong>3 Cool Things</strong></h3>
      <p><b>Computer Feature Everyone Needs 💻</b><br><a href="https://maccy.app/">Maccy</a></p>
      <p>This is an extra feature for copy and paste. I found I constantly will have to copy something, then copy another
        thing, paste it, and then go back and re-copy the original thing... this fixes that by keeping a copy and paste
        history accessible via a keyboard shortcut. This should be standard software on every computer.</p>
      <p><b>a16z Might Be Much More Than a VC Firm 💪</b><br><a

      <blockquote>"<i>a16z makes and sells power. It builds its own power through scale, culture, network, organizational
          infrastructure, and success, and then gives its power to the technology startups in its portfolio through sales,
          marketing, hiring, and government relations, primarily, although to hear its founders tell it, a16z will do
          whatever is in its power to do, which seems to be a lot.<br></i><i>If you were designing such an institution, one
          that believes that technology is “eating markets far larger than the technology industry has historically been
          able to pursue,” that Everything is Technology, what you would build is a company that sells the power to win to
          the hundreds and thousands of companies that might one day come to be the economy. I think you would build an
          institution that looks a lot like a16z."</i></blockquote>
