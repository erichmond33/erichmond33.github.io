      <h1>AI-only Companies, Awesome Earbuds, Email Notification Tips, and More</h1>
      <h3><strong>On Full AI Companies</strong></h3>
      <p>Brad Feld recently posted that he is trying to run an entire company using only AI agents – basically multiple windows
        of Claude Code all doing different job functions. It's a super interesting experiment that got me thinking. I don't
        think this is really possible today just based on my intuition using these agents most days, but I do think it soon
        will be.</p>
      <p>A year and a half ago, school assignments that required AI (ChatGPT, etc) to digest and use information included in
        images didn't work very well. You could give it textual work, but if it required images, it would fall flat. These
        days, AI can process any image with no issues and works just, very well. I think this will be the case with Brad's
        experiment; it'll be tough today with a lot of trial and error, but give it a year and it'll work just fine.</p>

      <h3><strong>3 Cool Things</strong></h3>
      <p><b>Earbuds I'm Loving 🎵 <br></b><a
          href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/ear-open?srsltid=AfmBOoqdXR03QO6kbDXJ7l8fp3Elz2ufJTWmBcAqG9QExD9O2wJJMayl&amp;Colour=White">Nothing
          Ear (Open)</a></p>
      <p>I used AirPods Pro 2 before I got these, but I was having some ear issues where the seal created by my AirPods were
        bothering me if I had to use them for a long period of time. These Nothing Ear (Open) earbuds sit over your ear
        rather than in it. They took a little while to get used to, but I much prefer them over a sealed earbud for any
        listening over an hour.</p>
      <p><b>Andrej Karpathy Says 80% of His Code is Written By AI 📝 <br></b><a
          href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876">Andrej's Tweet</a></p>
      <p>If you've been actively coding in the past year, you'd know this has been the case for a little while, but there is
        always this sense of cheating or being lazy so you never really know how much other people are using AI. Between
        Andrej and David Hansson both concluding that AI Agents are this good at coding, it kind of solidifies things.</p>
      <p><b>Computer </b><b>Email Notification Tips 🔔 </b><br></p>
      <p>I have two Outlook emails now... one for my work and the other is for school, but the web version of Outlook makes
        it very difficult for me to check both of these without using the Mac Outlook app. I realized all these years I've
        been using the tab at the top of Chrome as my email notification indicator – it doesn't make noise or pop up on my
        screen. It just puts a little 1 or whatever when I get an email.</p>
      <p>For the Mac app, you can get pop-up notifications or just have the badge update on the app's icon. I think the
        latter turned on with the former turned off is the way to go. My focus just gets wrecked by pop-ups. But some
        further nuance for my specific setup... I actually have both turned on, but my laptop is always in "Do Not Disturb"
        mode; I turn off DND when I am awaiting time-sensitive email. Additionally, my Dock and Menu Bar are hidden by
        default (to maximize screen space and, again, fewer distractions/visual simplicity), so I only see the badge update
        when I switch apps with Cmd + Tab. I think this is best.</p>

      <p>I don't know Brad personally, but he is a tech guy from way back. He occasionally posts really interesting stuff to
        his blog. His new book is pretty good too.</p>
