        <h1>You vs You #13 – I'm Pissed, Unexpected Marketing Hack, Free Books, and More</h1>
<h3><strong>On Dealt Hands...</strong></h3>
<p>Recently on a visit to UNC I got to talk with a bunch of current students who are also in the same field as me. This is the closest I've ever got to meeting true Ivy-League-caliber college kids. Each new person upset me more and more.</p>
<p>I'm pissed that they are in a better program than me. I'm <meta charset="utf-8">pissed that their family can support such an expensive college. I'm <meta charset="utf-8">pissed that many are genuinely probably flat-out smarter than me from an immovable IQ standpoint.</p>
<p>I'm grateful that I'm in a better program than many other people. I'm grateful that my family can support me to the extent they have so far. I'm grateful that I'm genuinely probably flat-out smarter than the majority of the population from an immovable IQ standpoint.</p>
<p>I think it is <meta charset="utf-8">paramount to be pissed. I think it is paramount to be grateful. Both should stir you to work.</p>
