            <p>
                My senior year I was the captain of the best 4a baseball team in the state of Arkansas. I had the 2nd highest batting average on the team (.419) and the highest on base percentage (). I lead. I put in the work. No doubt.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Self starter
            </h2>
            <p>
                I started learning Ai three years ago. The deep learning specialization on coursera was the last straw in my decision not to pursue collegiate level baseball. I want to do something big. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                The right reasons
            </h2>
            <p>
                I don't care about money or status. I want to work with other "A" players to make things people love and push humanity forward. 
            </p>

                Adaptomaniac

            <p>
                I'm not afraid rip open new problems. Last summer I decided to spend months learning about smart contracts and crypto and even shipped my own NFT project. I had no idea what I was doing, but I figured it out. I can handle anything that is thrown at me.

                I haven't solved any <I>really</I> big problems tbh, but I have people who would vouch for my ability to do so. For my current CS research, I've built the website, and I'll be as involved as I want to be with the GAN we will be using. My research mentor gave me the job in my first semester of college, and I've got others who can attest to my non-technical abilities if you want their information.

                (I think this goes without saying, but obviously I know programming. Specifically python, C, C++, solidity, SQL and a quite a bit about JS/HTML/CSS)
