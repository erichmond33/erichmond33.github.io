            <p>
                My senior year I was the captain of the best 4a baseball team in the state of Arkansas. I had the highest on base percentage (.528) and the 2nd highest batting average on the team (.419).

            <p>
                I decided not to pursue collegiate level baseball shortly after I began teaching myself about Ai three years ago. The deep learning specialization on coursera is when I began hitting my stride. I also love learning about the brain - mostly out of curiosity. However, it could lead to interesting insights.
            </p>
            <h5>
                The right reasons
            </h5>
            <p>
                I don't care about money or perks. I want to work with other "A" players to make things people love and push humanity forward.

                I'm not afraid rip open new problems. In fact, I love it! Last summer I decided to spend months learning about smart contracts and crypto and even shipped my own NFT project. I had no idea what I was doing, but I figured it out.

            <p>
                I haven't solved any <I>really</I> big problems yet tbh, but I have many people who would vouch for my abilities to do so. I was talking to my professor in my first semester of college, and he needed an undergrad to build a website and work on the accompanying GAN for <a href="../now.html#research" target="_blank">some research</a> that had recently got a $30000 grant. You might ask him about my problem solving abilities since I've been on his research team since that conversation.

                (I think this goes without saying, but obviously I know programming. Specifically python, C, C++, solidity, SQL and a quite a bit about JS/HTML/CSS)
