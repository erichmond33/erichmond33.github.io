                TLDR; Steven (<a href="https://StevenScrawls.com" target="_blank">StevenScrawls.com</a>) is upset because he is now realizing that college doesn't teach the answer to the most important question: “What’s worth doing?”

                Special thanks to Taylor for having the insight to share Steven's email on his blog.

                I recently <a href="/pardon-2023">pardoned all junior engineers</a>.</p>
                <p>
                In response, Steven (<a href="http://stevenscrawls.com">stevenscrawls.com</a>) sent me a
                lovely and heartfelt email. I’m quoting it here, unedited, with permission.</p>
                <p>
                It’s been a delight chatting with him over the past few months. I’ve grown to
                admire his pragmatism, optimism, and courage!</p>
                <p>
                Steven is looking to contribute to “radically worthwhile” projects, so feel free
                to <a href="mailto:hello@stevenscrawls.com">email him</a> with opportunities and
                suggestions.</p>
                <p>
                Anyway, I hope you all enjoy his original email as much as I do:</p>

                <p>
                Hi Taylor, </p>
                <p>
                (Sorry for the weird formatting) </p>
                <p>
                I’ve been reading your site for months now and there have been a few times
                I’ve thought of reaching out and never did, but I ended up writing this
                because your post on ‘pardoning the junior engineer’ resonated with me, and I
                guess I’m just trying to work through some things. My e-mail ended up being
                really long. Things I write often do. Also, I sort of stole your style a bit
                while writing. That was mostly an accident. </p>
                <p>
                I’m a few years out of college and your piece seems to be partially about
                people like me. I studied programming because I felt that I’d always regret
                not learning it if I didn’t. I studied it because I looked at the advanced
                courses and yearned for that knowledge. </p>
                <p>
                I received it. I learned to make computers see and reason and multitask. All
                fields are like their own form of magic, but programming is among the
                flashiest. Physicists spend years carving runes into the earth to grasp
                knowledge that only they will understand; programmers can build a website in a
                weekend and transmit their thoughts to anyone in the world who cares to
                listen. Alakazam. </p>
                <p>
                When I left college, my fingertips crackled with electricity. I did projects
                for fun that I would barely have dreamed possible a few years before. </p>
                <p>
                But I’d been snared by the great seduction of an engineering education. I
                dreamed of doing good in the world—but dreaming in the worst sense of the
                word. My dreams were vague, baseless visions of an oversimplified or
                fantastical world, where problems are manufactured by the dreamer’s mind to
                create the environment where fancy algorithms are the solution. </p>
                <p>
                When I wanted to learn to solve problems, the grand wheels of institutions
                churned to deliver the knowledge I sought. They rarely mentioned how to find
                problems worth solving. The worthiness of the task was assumed. When I thought
                to ask what was worth doing, there was silence, or confusion, or platitudes.
                Do you want to know ‘how’? Go to office hours and have an expert in the field
                explain every detail. Do you want to know ‘why?’ I guess you can go spelunking
                for blog posts on the Internet. </p>
                <p>
                I get it. Knowing which problems are worth solving is far, far harder than how
                those problems can be solved. I’m not angry at my professors for their
                didactic failure. “What’s worth doing?” requires speculation and an
                opinionated worldview that is difficult to assume in a classroom. I doubt that
                a mandatory “Not Squandering Your Talent 101” would do a great deal of good. </p>
                <p>
                It’s just that when I look around it seems abundantly obvious that we have
                failed miserably, and the problem is both gargantuan and utterly unchanged by
                our technical prowess. Our critical institutions tear off their own limbs to
                bloat their stomachs. Meanwhile, many—most?—tech workers play a dull,
                lucrative version of Candy Crush: solve a manufactured problem and your score
                goes up. We don’t fix the important problems—why would you fix a problem? How
                much money is there in abusing tax loopholes? How much money is there in
                closing them? </p>
                <p>
                My mind tells me that I want to do good in the world, but the overwhelming
                evidence of my actions disagrees. I spent half my weekday waking hours
                building a product that on my most generous days I think is morally neutral
                and on most days I think probably shouldn’t exist. I dream again, but this
                time I dream not of solutions set against a backdrop of imagined problems, but
                of simply having a worthwhile problem in the first place. It feels sadder,
                somehow, than the misguided dreams of solutions that came before, even though
                it is more honest, more raw. </p>
                <p>
                I should leave, I think—and go where? And do what? </p>
                <p>
                Anyone with enough spare money to hire a software developer has certainly
                extracted a great deal of value, but nobody really bothers checking if they
                added any. Everyone needs to drink, but nobody needs to fill the reservoir. </p>
                <p>
                I will admit I have barely even looked at job opportunities. The thought of
                looking at job postings feels empty. It is an impressive job posting that even
                explains what the role is, let alone why it ought to be done. I fear that part
                of me wants to remain helpless, remain tragically troubled, remain trapped
                under the weight of a world that isn’t actually crushing me. You said that
                whenever you find yourself endlessly fighting the world, perhaps your values
                need to change. I see the wisdom there, but I can’t help but think that, well,
                maybe the world actually is in need of a good thrashing. </p>
                <p>
                Time passes. I spend time with my friends and work fades into the background.
                I get used to spending my days pouring my electricity into a miles-high metal
                contraption. The mechanical behemoth churns through the world, and I do not
                know if it moves for good or ill. It seems that if we build a monstrosity of
                this size, there should be robust debate on what it’s doing. It is nobody’s
                job to argue that we ought to slow down—nobody on the behemoth, at least.
                There aren’t even brakes on the beast, only wizards pushing it ever faster.
                Some wizards are catapulted off to save weight. Our leaders chant “TEAM. TEAM.
                TEAM.” in the hopes that we will be fooled. </p>
                <p>
                It’s depressing enough that, among my friends, nobody cares about what they
                do. Nobody even talks about it. It’s almost an accepted part of life that the
                whole industry is a waste of time. Sometimes, rarely, I meet someone who does
                something worthwhile—usually not in the industry—and the difference seems
                staggering. If there are people who will die if you don’t ship your product,
                then of course you would work hard. Sounds a lot better than fighting for a
                promotion just to make more money I won’t spend. </p>
                <p>
                When you spend all day with your fingers to the metal beast, you forget that
                electricity is flowing at all. You don’t hear the crackle and don’t see the
                sparks. And if you stop for a minute, an hour, a day, or longer, things barely
                change. The difference to the behemoth is nigh-imperceptible. You forget the
                power you possess. Your job is to press your hands to a mechanical behemoth
                for eight hours a day. Performative. The world that was once a tapestry of
                arcane potential is once more an immutable backdrop to your everyday life. </p>
                <p>
                This feels like an impossibly tragic outcome. Sometimes I do something that
                makes me hear the crackling again. My fingers itch to cast a spell worth
                shaping. </p>
                <p>
                My life experience, and your blog, have encouraged me to try to take
                responsibility for the outcomes of my actions, and so part of me always wants
                to attribute everything to myself. But when I think of what I should’ve done,
                it’s…what? Become a startup founder? Understand how the world ought to work
                when I barely understand how it does? Be a famous public intellectual who
                takes bold stances? Be a Twitter ‘activist’? </p>
                <p>
                I won’t deny that maybe I could’ve done some of those things, perhaps even
                should have, but it seems like a lot to ask. Still, I might be willing to take
                drastic measures if I knew what those measures were. I would not be surprised
                if your advice would be to pick a date to submit my two weeks’ notice and then
                start researching my next steps. Perhaps this is indeed the way forward, but I
                feel hesitant when I don’t even know where the trail to worthwhile begins. </p>
                <p>
                All this said, I guess it just felt nice to be pardoned this Thanksgiving, and
                though I have taken my thoughts here in a slightly different direction than
                your post took yours, I still feel the essence of both comes from a place of
                looking at the state of programming and thinking “Really? This is what we’re
                doing?” </p>
                <p>
                If you have any thoughts you’d like to share on this tome I’ve just lobbed at
                you, I’d be happy to hear them, but if not, then I’m happy just saying thank
                you so much for your blog. I have found it to be a beautiful invitation to
                self-reclamation, and I feel it has been a lantern in my troubled search for
                the scattered pieces of agency that should have been mine from the beginning. </p>
                <p>
