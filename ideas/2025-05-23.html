                        <p class="dropcap">Brian Chesky’s dad wasn’t thrilled he had decided to go to art school. Chesky promised him he
                            would not move back home to live in their basement, and that when he was done, he’d get a real job with
                            health care benefits.</p>
                        <p>And he did. But at age 22 he was overcome by a “weird feeling of mortality.” A sense of “this is my life”:
                            Commuting in LA traffic alone to a job in a design company. It was a let down after he’d started to believe
                            the high-minded rhetoric from Rhode Island School of Design that designers could “design the world around
                            them.”</p>
                        <p>He quit that job, rolled up a foam bed into his crappy Honda Civic and moved in with his old design pal Joe
                            Gebbia in San Francisco. In a bid to pay rent, they opened up their home to attendees of a design conference
                            coming to town.</p>
                        <p>Most profiles will tell you that “the rest is history.” But that skips over the best part of the <a
                                href="https://www.airbnb.com/" node="[object Object]" target="_blank" class="sco-0">Airbnb</a> CEO’s
                            story. So, back in 2013, I sat down with Brian to discuss the sheer insanity that stood in between that
                            “aha!” moment of Airbnb and anyone in Silicon Valley wanting to fund this thing.</p>
                        <p>Airbnb absolutely should have died long before it got close to Y-Combinator. Why they didn’t is a story of
                            $40,000 in maxed out credit cards, dozens of rejections, a lost cell signal that almost tanked the company,
                            burned fingers, a high fiber diet of “Cap’n McCains”, everyone around him thinking he was nuts.</p>
                        <p>No matter how screwed your startup may seem, the early days of Airbnb was even worse.</p>

                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><strong>Brian Chesky:</strong> &nbsp;<em>When I was at RISD, I wanted to also
                                pursue some sort of sports, and we didn’t have very many sports, so I just started weightlifting.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>I like to say that I’ve lived like a number of lives. The first life was as a
                                hockey player, second life was as an artist. Then, for a period of time, I was a bodybuilder, then I was
                                an industrial designer. Now, here I am as an entrepreneur.</em></p>
                        <h3><strong>SL:</strong> &nbsp;You would compete and just go somewhere in a Speedo, get oiled up and&nbsp;flex.

                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><strong>BC: &nbsp;</strong><em>Yeah. It’s all on the Internet. I did this before I
                                realized the consequences of the Internet, and so here I am.</em></p>
                        <h3><strong>SL: &nbsp;</strong>You’re a cautionary tale. Other than mocking you, I bring up the bodybuilder
                            thing, because, you are different from the typical Silicon Valley CEO in a lot of&nbsp;ways.</h3>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><strong>BC: &nbsp;</strong><em>Our backgrounds were considered a liability when I
                                got here. A lot of investors did not want to invest in us because of who I was.</em></p>
                        <h3><strong>SL: &nbsp;</strong>A bodybuilder.</h3>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><strong>BC:</strong> &nbsp;<em>The artist more than the bodybuilder. They never
                                found that part out. Going to the Rhode Island School of Design wasn’t an asset. I remember when I went
                                to RISD and…It’s an incredibly competitive time. For the very first time, you’re meeting other artists
                                that are really good. You want to imagine that you’re going to be one of the best.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>The first day of class I had this teacher and he asked us to do this
                                self‑portrait. We designed the self‑portrait and everyone spends eight hours. You spend all week. We
                                want to do this amazing project. We go in front of the class. We all put our self‑portraits on the wall
                                and everyone’s like, “Oh, I should have tried harder, I should have done this. I should have done
                                that.”</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>You complete the assignment and then the teacher gives you next week’s
                                assignment. Next week’s assignment is to do 200 self‑portraits.</em></p>
                        <h3><strong>SL:</strong> &nbsp;Oh my&nbsp;God.</h3>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><strong>BC: &nbsp;</strong><em>Suddenly you just spent eight hours and now clearly
                                there’s not enough hours in the week. The point was it was a seemingly impossible solution, but with
                                creativity you can always find a way. Another thing they taught me at RISD was that everything that
                                exists around you that’s man‑made was designed by somebody. That somebody was a designer.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>When you know that, you know you can change that. Because you’re a designer,
                                and you can design the world around you. You can live in a world of your own design.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>I think that’s a really powerful thing. I think one of the things that
                                entrepreneurs love is they can actually live in a world of their own design. When you’re building a
                                company, you’re building a world which you get to live in and it’s a world of your values.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>You create the rules, you create the values, and, eventually, if you’re
                                successful, that world grows. I think all of these things came from our education at RISD.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>This is totally different where I came from. I grew up in upstate New York. My
                                parents are social workers. My dad had some anxiety about me being an artist, about me going to art
                                school, because it seemed to mean that I was eventually going to move back home and live in their
                                basement or something, which is probably not totally unreasonable.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>My dad said to me, “I’ll support you in going to RISD, but make sure one day
                                you get a job with health insurance.”</em></p>

                            of&nbsp;dollars.”</h3>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><strong>BC:</strong> &nbsp;<em>No. He said, “Make sure one day you get a job with
                                health insurance, and do not come back to our basement, please.” After graduation I did actually move
                                back home, so that was hard, but eventually I got a job. But, RISD was an amazing experience for me. I
                                went to RISD, Rhode Island School of Design, with my cofounder now, Joe Gebbia, and we were the two
                                entrepreneurs on campus.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>We ran these sports clubs. I ran the hockey team, he ran the basketball team.
                                To run an athletic team in art school…by the way, that’s the biggest marketing challenge in the world:
                                To get an art student to go to a hockey game.</em></p>
                        <h3><strong>SL:</strong> &nbsp;I was going to say, between tech, art, and sports, that’s a bizarre combo. That’s
                            like Peter Thiel being a creationist/ libertarian/&nbsp;Christian.</h3>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><strong>BC:</strong> &nbsp;<em>Yes, exactly. So, we were these two entrepreneurs on
                                campus…The day of graduation, Joe looks at me and says, “Brian, I think one day we’re going to start a
                                company together.”</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>At that point I had finally succeeded in getting my job with health insurance
                                in Los Angeles, California, in a tiny design firm.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>The first six months, I really liked it, because when you’re a designer, the
                                thing you want most is to get something on the shelf. It’s like a screenwriter wants their screenplay to
                                actually become a movie. That’s the most important thing.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>I worked in LA. I started designing products. Over the course of a year, I
                                became so alienated. Here, I went to RISD. At RISD, they said you can live in a world of your design,
                                that you can change the world.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>People actually said to me, “You can change the world.” That seemed absurd,
                                given my background. I wasn’t told to change the world growing up. I was taught to fit in. I was taught
                                to fit in. I was taught to keep quiet, sit down, stop drawing, stop doodling, pay attention, do your
                                homework.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>I was taught to conform and fit in. Here, I went to a school where I was
                                taught, “You can change the world. You can do whatever.” Then I go back to the workplace, and actually,
                                it was like growing up. Just sit there, be quiet, deliver this assignment, whatever.</em></p>
                        <p style="padding-left:45px"><em>I remember one day, it was like I woke up. It was like I was in a car. I
                                remember having this vision. I was in this car, I could see the road disappearing in the horizon. I
                                would look in the rear view mirror, and it was the same road. It was like that was my life. I had this
                                weird feeling of mortality, like, “This is my life.”</em></p>

                                I wanted to do with my life. I knew that this whole thing of getting a job, health insurance, it wasn’t
                                all it was cracked up to be, because I just wasn’t happy.</em></p>

                                2,000‑3,000 pound vehicle that seats five people, by myself, looking next to me, in front of me, behind

                                very, very simple. It was only slightly better than Craigslist, which is pretty bad.</em></p>
