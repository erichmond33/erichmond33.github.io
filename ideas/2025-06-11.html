                The Unreality of Pro Wrestling
            </h2>
            <p>
                On a Joe Rogan podcast Rick Rubin dropped the single most intriguing and confusing statement I'd ever heard: <blockquote>"I believe wrestling is more real than reality."</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                For a few years all I could do was guess at what Rick meant by this. Despite going to the internet for more information, he didn't have any other public conversations that touched on this at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I watched pro wrestling trying to understand what Rick saw. I still couldn't understand; it was just silly, fake wrestling... until I found this crazy, mind-bending Youtube video.
            </p>
            <p>
                To me this video captures the "Unreality" of life if pro wrestling is looked at like a mirror of reality rather than entirely fake version of it. You'll better understand what Rick meant and take home an important lession in skepticism about the truths we are presented with in day-to-day life. I strongly encourage you to give this video a chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently I found Rick's more direct take on pro wrestling, and I'll leave you with this quote before stepping into this amazing film.

            <p>
                <blockquote>"There are countless situations in life where the truth is unclear and it is hard to tell what is real vs scripted."</blockquote>
