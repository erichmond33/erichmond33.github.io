            <p>
                As a person who walks the line of business and creative behavior, often this point of view is underrepresented.
                Enough is often plenty.

                    <p>When Shawn Coyne and I were first brainstorming the business concept behind Black Irish Entertainment, our
                        two-man company that publishes <em>The War of Art</em> and its cousins, we wondered just how ambitious we
                        wanted to be.</p>
                    <span id="more-23185"></span>
            
            
                    <p>We decided, Not all that ambitious.</p>
            
            
            
                    <p>We agreed it would be okay to leave some money on the table.</p>
            
            
                    <p>This may not be the smartest way to run a business. It’s certainly not the standard American model. By such a
                        model, an entrepreneur would aim to milk every dollar they possibly could from their enterprise. They would
                        scale it. They would max it out. They would take it to the moon.</p>
            
            
            
                    <p>Maybe I’m crazy but that concept had very little appeal to me.</p>
            
            
            
                    <p>As an example, if I wanted to take <em>The War of Art</em> “on the road,” I could do speaking gigs, I could
                        produce courses, hold workshops, blah blah etc.</p>
            
            
            
                    <p>I have no interest in that whatsoever.</p>
            
            
            
                    <p>I’m happy with the books <em>as books</em>. I’m happy with the audios <em>as audio</em>.</p>
            
            
            
                    <p>I don’t want to drive myself crazy in order to vacuum up every possible dime.</p>
            
            
            
                    <p>Like I say, maybe I’m foolish. I feel the same way about “size of life” (if there is such a term.) It’s the
                        American way, I know, when we hit a jackpot of any kind to immediately buy a fancy car, move to an upgraded
                        neighborhood … in other words, to extend ourselves to the outer limits of our wherewithal.</p>
            
            
            
                    <p>I don’t believe in that either. I remember when Jerry Brown was governor of California—the first time—people
                        used to make fun of him for driving around Sacramento in a state motor pool ’74 Plymouth Satellite. And his
                        girlfriend at the time was Linda Ronstadt!</p>
            
            
            
                    <p>That’s the simple life. That’s living within your means. That’s my kind of governor.</p>
