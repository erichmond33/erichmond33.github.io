                John Cena Reflects on Living Out of His Car

            <p>
                This is really interesting, and exactly the kind of decisions I'm talking about in <a href="../articles/2023-05-28"><i>Crazy or courageous?</i></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Can't you imagine all of his friends saying, "Why are you so crazy John?
                Wait you are living out of your car?!"
            </p>
            <p>
                And he is going through these hard times <i>by choice</i>.
                I love that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if we could bring ourselves to take a leap like this, how long could you last?
                Could you take this repeated failure?
                Or would you quit?
            </p>
            <p>
                I also love how he casually defends living in his car with, "Well a Lincoln Continental is a big car."
            </p>
            <p>
                But seriously, he lived out of his car for 4 months and then out of a garage for 6 more, <i>when he could have went home at any moment.</i>
