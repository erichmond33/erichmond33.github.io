            <small>Here is a blog post about how Pieter got started using these ideas, <a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/">12 Startups in 12 Months</a>. His 7th one, NomadList, took off and still brings in quite a lot of money for him to this day.</small>

                Bootstrapped Start-ups
            </h2>
            <h3>
                The indie way of building a startup
            </h3>
            <p>
                I want to write a book, if only because I see so much bullshit going around in the world of startups and tech. The
                media is presenting startups in the wrong way. People think they need to build billion dollar companies. They need
                to fly to San Francisco and build a "network" and get $10 million dollar investment from old rich guys. They need to
                hire 10x power developers and work them for 100-hour work weeks while feeding them pizza and soda. It will be great,
                they said.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it won't. It'll probably suck. And you probably won't get rich. Because the odds of a venture capital (VC)
                funded startup are by definition stacked against you. Only 10% or less exit and that doesn't even tell you if the
                founders make good money. There's giant company exits where the founders barely made money. That's why I'm writing
                this. To show you, you might be able to do it differently.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's the alternative? How about this: do things yourself and build a nice side project, that then can maybe turn
                into a bigger project, that then maybe becomes a company that makes you enough money to quit your day job and stop
                working for the man. Enough money to build up good savings, that if you invest well, will give you a nice early
                retirement. Your own company that can give you a little more freedom in your daily life, so you can spend it with
                friends, your family, your pets or just doing the things you love. Which in the best case is actually building an
                app, project, startup or company you love to work at/on/for!
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>
                I want to make bootstrapping great (again) #MBGA
            </h3>
            <p> This way of building a company is called "bootstrapped". Which means you're self-funded. You use the resources you
                have to get started. The odds of building a successful bootstrapped business are way higher than building a venture
                funded billion dollar company. Because the goal of a boot- strapped business is much more reachable. You don't need
                to do a billion dollars in revenue. You're already there if you can pay yourself enough to live from. Any money that
                comes extra is even better! You'll probably have less stress, be happier and be therefore a better friend, lover,
                partner or parent. Just....relax. </p>
            <p>The coolest thing about bootstrapping it is that it doesn't exclude "going big" later. Venture capital investors LOVE
                to invest in companies that already have proven revenue. And that's literally what a bootstrapped business is.
                You'll be miles further than the person next to you pitching with just a PowerPoint deck. When you go for millions
                of dollars of VC investment on day one, it means you do exclude building a healthy simple business. Your company is
                now strapped to a rocket and you need to go big or explode. That's why I think bootstrapping is the better way to
                build a business now.</p>
            <p>I really, truly, honestly want to see the mainstream startup narrative change into one where bootstrapping, revenue
                and actual profit is "cool". Writing a book on it with a proven framework people can apply, may help accelerate this
                change. </p>
            <p>There's a personal legacy aspect here: if I can have a small influence in changing this, it feels good as a person.
                It's nice to change things for the better. And if it doesn't, well, thousands of people paid me money for this book,
                so it's a nce backup for me in case I go bankrupt. </p>
            <h3>You'll need persistence, and luck </h3>
            <p>You may need to try shipping 10 to 30 products for 1 to 3 years before you have anything that works. That's how this
                approach works. You build stuff and see what sticks. I don't know anybody who shipped one product and instantly
                became successful. It takes a long time to "get" it and even then it's a lot of luck and timing. If something
                doesn't seem to take off early on, it probably won't take off later, so make something new and try again. </p>
                <p>As I, and this book practice radical honesty, there's a chance nothing you make will be successful. But by doing
                    you'll have figured something new out, that might lead you to somewhere else, that will make you successful.
                    Startups, and life, are about constantly pivoting when things don't work out. If you don't take action though, you
                    can be sure nothing will ever hap- pen. Stagnancy kills. So ship. </p>
                <p>Always keep shipping. </p>

                </h2>
                <h3>Idea </h3>
                <p>Get an idea from problems in your own life. If you don't have problems that are original enough, become a more
                    original person. Don't build products that are solutions in search of a problem.</p>
                <h3>Build </h3>
                <p>
                    Build your idea with the tools you already know. Don't spend a year learning some language you'll never use. Don't
                    outsource building to other people, that's a competitive disadvantage. Build only the core functionality. The rest
                    comes later.
                
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Launch
                
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Launch early and multiple times. Launch to famous startups websites (like Product Hunt, Hacker News, The Next Web),
                    mainstream websites (like Reddit) and mainstream press (like Forbes).
                
                </p>
                <p>But more importantly, find where your specific audience hangs out on the internet (or in real life) and launch there.
                    Launch in a friendly way, that means "here's something I made that might be useful for you", instead of acting like
                    you're some big giant new startup coming to change the world. </p>
                <h3>
                    Grow
                
                </h3>
                <p>Grow organically. A great product that people really need which is better than the rest will pull people in. You
                    don't need ads for that. </p>
                <p>
                    Don't hire people if there's no revenue yet. Don't hire many people if there's revenue either. Stay lean and fast.
                    Do things yourself.
                
                </p>
                <h3>Monetize</h3>
                <p>
                    Monetize by asking users for money. Don't sell their data. Don't put ads everywhere. Don't dilute your product. Be
                    honest that you need money to build the product they love and they'll be fine paying for it.
                
                </p>
                <h3>Automate</h3>
                <p>
                    Automate by writing programs that do stuff that you do repeatedly. Only automate if it's worth the time saved. For
                    stuff that's too hard to automate or not worth it, hire contractors. Let them work as autonomously as possible.
                    Where possible let robots manage them (for example by giving them alerts when things happen in your product). This
                    lets you take time off, or work on your next business.
                
                </p>
                <h3>Exit</h3>
                <p>
                    Exit by not putting your company for sale, but letting buyers come to you. Filter out the majority of buyers that
                    aren't serious. With the serious buyers left, negotiate a price by evaluating your own company. Price it
                    aggressively high. Always keep the bargaining power on your side of the table. Get paid in cash, not stock and don't
                    fall for the trap of earn-out bonuses. Make sure you're prepared for the emotional fallout of selling (and missing)
                    your business.
