        The Best Introductory Coding Course. Period.
        </h1>
        <p>
        Like me, many years ago, I assume your idea of a programmer is this mystical creature that is only seen in broad daylight on rare occasions. You have a vague idea of what "coding" entails, but for some crazy reason - I was interested in Ai - you have decided that you want to learn how to code.
        </p>
        <p>
        Take Harvard's free online course, CS50x: Introduction to CS.
        </p>
        <p>
        I took this is high school, and it was and is better than my entry level CS classes at my current college!
        </p>
        <p>
        You will get the perfect blend of depth and breadth in this entry level course. Once you finish CS50x, they actually have three follow up courses CS50w (websites), CS50ai (Ai), and CS50g (games). I have only taken the two former classes, but I have no doubt the latter is just as fantastic.
        </p>
        <p>
        I can't express my gratitude and excitement enough. David Malan, Brain Yu, and Doug Llyod are all fantastic teachers, and their style and enthusiasm should be imitated by professors around the globe.

        If you guys see this... Thank You.
