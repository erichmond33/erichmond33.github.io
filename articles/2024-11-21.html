                <b>Policy #1:</b> I am not expecting a gift, and you shouldn't feel pressured to bring one.
            </p><p>
                <i><b>Policy #2:</b> If you are compelled to get me a gift but are unsure what to get (gift giving is hard!), go to a thrift shop, Goodwill, etc and find the silliest, funniest, dumbest thing you can find under $10 – something super random that really cracks you up.
                    That's the perfect gift for me.
                    I can't wait to see what you find!</i>
            </p><p>
                <b>Policy #3:</b> If you are compelled to get me a gift and do have something in mind, I'm going to love it no matter what.
                Some of my favorite shirts are my favorite simply because they were a gift from someone close and not because I would've picked them out myself.
            </p><p>
                <b>Policy #4:</b> Refer to #1. Seriously, I'm just glad to see you :)
            </p>

                This is weird.
                Why did you write this?
            </p><p>
                I hate the grey area of not really knowing whether I'm expected to bring a gift for other people's birthdays.
                This is meant to clear that up for the people I invite.
