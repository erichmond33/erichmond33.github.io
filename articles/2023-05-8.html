            </h2>
            <p>
                Great teams are beautiful.
                If you ever get the chance to be in a group working extremely hard towards a shared interest, please give it all you've got or leave.
            </p><p>
                This is one of the rarest experiences.
                We will only get a handful of these opportunities, if we are lucky.
            </p><p>
                Great teams are more capable than the sum of their parts.
                Extra care gets compounded in ways it normally wouldn't.
                However, lack of care compounds in the opposite direction.
            </p><p>
                We should consider caring deeply.
                Nobody lives too full a life.
                And when we choose not to care and not to leave, we are corroding something beautiful and fragile.
            </p><p>
                Nothing excites me more than these rare opportunities.
