            <h2>
                Crazy or courageous?
            </h2>
            <p>
                A few key moments will define us.
                I've noticed when I'm faced with these impactful decisions, there have been two choices: normal or crazy.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice is almost always blatantly harder, requiring more work, consistency, and creativity.
                But also this route forces us to go against the grain of social convention.
                This causes friction with friends, family, bosses, committees, etc.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice hurts so good.
                The pain is immense.
                But the satisfaction is too.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice requires humility.
                It could be, well - crazy.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice will reveal our friends.
                Some people won't stick around when we go our own way.
                But the relationships that hold up become stronger.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice is scary/exciting.
                It requires us to put something on the line.
                We could publicly fail.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice often minimizes regret.
                We can always be normal.
                The window for crazy can be fleeting.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice might be the courageous choice.
                Most of the time choosing crazy has turned out great for me, far greater than the normal choice.
                Next time you are feeling a lot of opposition, consider that you might not be crazy.
                Maybe you are being courageous.
            </p><p>
                We need your courage.
            </p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                To my friends and family that have put up with my craziness over the years, Thank You :)
