                Cheers to the worst year of my life
            </h2>
            <p>
            The last year of my life has been one big long shit show full of confusion and failure at every turn.
            The past week, on a trip to Austin, Texas, it feels like I've turned a corner for the better.
            Maybe I've still got a decade of crap to trudge through, but at the very least, I've got a temporary little boost confidence from crushing a few of my fears.
            To start, let's rewind the clock back to December 2024.
            </p>
            <h3>
            December 2024
            </h3>
            <p>
            I've got one semester before graduation and know exactly how hard it was for me to get an internship over the summer, so I have my resume polished and start shipping out applications to startups and tech companies in San Francisco, the Palo Alto area, and Austin like crazy.
            I've got all the internships and projects and done all the right things to be able to get a software engineering job.
            In this four to five month period before summer, I probably send out hundreds of applications via online job boards with literally zero success – not one interview!
            No problem, I don't want a normal job that bad anyways and find a $700 a month place to live in San Francisco.
            </p>
            <h3>
            May 2024
            </h3>
            <p>
            Technically I've got one online class left to graduate, but I move to San Francisco anyways in search of the future I'd been dreaming about since the 11th grade!
            I'm feeling awe and amazement as I fly over all these historic places of technical innovation only to be thrown into a state of anxiety and fear upon touching down.
            There are crackheads on the bus and even more in the city!
            So much commotion and everyone feels like they want to steal from or hurt me.
            I'm paralyzed and don't want to leave my room, but eventually I do and the city becomes much less scary.
            The energy and bustle turns out to be quite addicting.
            However, my first taste of the tech scene in SF is not a good one.
            All I can remember is the look of desperation and a sense of feigning in the eyes of all the founders I met – exactly the opposite kind of sexiness that someone like Steve Jobs would radiate.
            Whatever this was, I wanted to be far, far away from it.
            There was one old man in particular that really scared me.
            He was probably 50 with no wife and no kids just pitching me on his AI blah blah blah company with absolutely piercing eyes of unhappiness, regret, and lack of control.
            This was not the land of dreams.
            It was the land of desperation, so I left.
            </p>
            <h3>
            August 2024
            </h3>
            <p>
            The past four years of my life had been devoted, and I mean devoted, including many sacrifices and long hours working on my craft because I wanted to do a tech startup.
            That is all I cared about.
            That is what I was doing.
            Then in one month, BOOM!
            Dreams, crushed.
            Purpose, gone.
            I'm absolutely spiraling in terms of finding any sort of meaning from anything.
            Nonetheless, two months have gone by, and I'm feeling the pressure to figure something out from my parents.
            In retrospect, no matter what decision I made at this time was bound to be a bad one because there just weren't any good options for me at the time; nonetheless, I drove out to Palo Alto, which is about an hour below SF and more suburb-ish, to try and move there by any means necessary.
            I was super lonely and despite having more opportunity in tech on paper, it felt so boring and non-opportunistic, so I left after only a week only furthering my feelings of failure and inadequacy.
            The first day I arrived a few Stanford kids were sitting in the living room and asked why I was moving.
            I said, "I'm looking for work in tech" to which they replied, "Well why did you come here? I've been applying for 6 months."... talk about a mood killer.
            </p>
            <h3>
            October 2024
            </h3>
            <p>
            After coming home from Palo Alto, I'm ready to take any damn job even remotely close to computer science.
            I apply to some customer service jobs and the two whole programming jobs we have in Jonesboro only to either be not contacted or to be passed up after the first interview.
            I'm done applying to online job boards unless I have a reference – I just can't keep doing something that isn't working.
            I get a reference from my friend at Google only to not even get a call from three different jobs there.
            Eventually I do decide I want to try and move to Austin but figured I'd take a more patient approach since the impatient ones hadn't worked.
            Then I decide I'll try entry level sales if it will get me out of my hometown.
            I scrounge around and get references and a few interviews but ultimately don't end up finding anything over the course of four months.
            All the while, I'm 22 years old and living out of my parent's house.
            Mom thinks I should get a part-time job at the gym or something just so I'll have a job, but I don't think that will actually help me get any of the jobs I want.
            If this isn't the definition of a loser, I don't know what is.
            My confidence is at rock fucking bottom.
            </p><p>
            The few interviews I did get during this time wildly reshaped my outlook on what makes a person successful though.
            My whole life I've believed that if you work hard enough and get good enough at something, you'll be successful eventually.
            False.
            The people you know really, really matters.
            In fact, I'd go so far as to say it isn't even possible to be extraordinarily better than everyone at anything – the margin for top performers becomes so thin that you are competing with a massive pool of people with nearly indistinguishable talent/skill.
            So yes you have to be good, perhaps great, but lots of people can do that.
            The separator is who you know.
            Careers are not made in isolation.
            Your success will come from others lifting you up.
            I think if I had come to SF via a startup or via my network from an Ivy League school, my experience and first impression might have been much different.
            This is the reason why Silicon Valley people can fail three times and still win big.
            Their network they build along the way is more valuable than gold.
            This is why degrees from Stanford, Harvard, etc are so valuable.
            Sure, you'll meet great people while you are there, but also it quickly and easily signals to other important people that they should believe in and befriend you down the road – it is building your valuable network on easy mode.
            The alternative to reading a bullet point that says "Stanford" is scouring someone's Github which is time consuming and probably still won't be that beneficial unless one of their projects is massively popular or has made money – the only two currencies that are easily understandable.
            Of course, in reality the truth is likely somewhere more towards the middle of ability and network... maybe.

            January 2025
            </h3>
            <p>
            Nothing I'm doing is working.
            It is failure after failure after failure.
            The worst part is I'm terrified of moving again.
            I know my career has no room to grow in my hometown, but after my last attempt to move, I am just afraid that I don't have the courage it takes to move away.
            As an ambitious and person, this is a death sentence.
            I'm a big believer in the motto: "If it scares you, do it."
            At every other point in my life, relative to now, I had boundless courage, but I genuinely felt like I might not be able to beat this.
            But I had to try.
            I booked a week-long trip to Austin, Texas.
            In the past, I had found month-long stays but honestly figured I'd just fail again.
            The idea was to try and find minimum wage work during this week and try not to feel as lonely and unimpressed as I'd felt in Palo Alto.
            While I didn't find work, I did have a great week.
            I love the city!
            It is like my hometown except with better weather, more fun, more opportunity, and more women!
            I am 100% certain I could live there.
            </p>
            <h3>
            Closing thoughts
            </h3>
            <p>
            Yes, I haven't made it out of Arkansas or into any decent job yet.
            Yes, I'm still right back where I started.
            Yes, I still have no clue what I actually want to do in life – at least, I don't have near the clarity I did when I was chasing startups full tilt.
            But I feel more capable and free than at any other point in my life: a confidence, calmness, and openness that comes from having absolutely nothing left to lose yet all the courage and curiosity in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a person who cares deeply about their work, it feels like life has taken everything from me, yet I'm still here, still fighting a year later.
            Bring it on, life.
            You can't hurt me.
            </p>
