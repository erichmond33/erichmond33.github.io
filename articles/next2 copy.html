                Have you ever been hanging out with friends, having a great time, when that one person who is way too active on social media wants to take picturesâ€”and you didn't dress the way you would've if you'd known pictures were going to be taken?
                You know this will get posted to social media and you'll have no say over which images get posted, which somehow are always the ones where you look extraordinarily ugly.
                As a byproduct of being used as a trophy for this person's Instagram, it makes you feel incredibly alone, as if the whole reason they showed up was to display to the world that they are interesting and not to see you.
                And since this makes you feel bad, you don't like asking others to take pictures, which means your camera roll is empty of memories, further making you feel like an isolated, friendless, loser?
            </p><p>
                Yeah, I've never felt this way either *laughs nervously*, but if you have, I have a fantastic solution that doesn't make people feel used, allows everyone to capture the moment with pictures and videos, and you still get to post them.
                Here is the simple trick...
            </p><p>
                Take as many pictures and videos as you want, and when all the men roll their eyes and people aren't happy about a picture being taken, say it is just for you.
                This communicates that the picture is low-stakes, and you <i>aren't</i> going to post it.
                It always works; nobody feels bad.
            </p><p>
                Months later, go back through your camera roll and compile all of these you've taken over weeks and weeks, and draft a pretty big post that goes back all these months.
                Before you post it, create a gaint group chat, and simply ask everyone if they are okay with all of these pictures being posted.
                You might have to remove a few per individual requests, but for the most part, nostalgia is a powerful emotion and people are much less self-conscious about an image taken months earlier.
            </p><p>
                <b><i>Take low-stakes pictures in the moment, get permission to use photos of other people (especisally your friends), and post on a significant delay,</i></b>
