                'What do you wanna do?'
            </p><p>
                I always feel like I'm lying when I answer this question.
                The gap between what I'm working on and the vision of what I wish to be working on makes this uncomfortable to answer.
            </p><p>
                'Hm.
                Do you want to be great?
                Ya know, do you want to do great things?'
            </p><p>
                The gap does seem to be shrinking over time though.
            </p><p>
                Puzzled, 'Um.'
            </p><p>
                'Most people don't care that much.
                They just want to live their lives and have food and a home and stuff.
                Which is cool I guess.'
            </p><p>
                I always feel like such a maniac no matter who I ask this question to.
            </p><p>
                Moderately unsure and uncomfortable, 'Yea.
                Yes, I do want to.
                I'd like to do great research, and sometimes I wonder if the papers being published here are actually worthwhile.'
            </p><p>
                'I know whatcha mean about the papers.
                I wanna be great too ya know.'
            </p><p>
                'Yeah, yeah.
                Like I wonder whether anyone will ever care about the effects of this obscure microorganism?'
            </p><p>
                'I think you'll understand where I'm coming from.
                Right now I feel very confident in my technical ability to build great products.
                But even if I had the insight to make something like an Apple 2, the computer that really made Apple take off, I wouldn't know how to sell it or turn it into a company.'
            </p><p>
                'Ah so you are like Steve Wozniak without Steve Jobs around.'
            </p><p>
                'Yea kinda.
                And I'd be open to working with a Steve Jobs, but I'm not gonna wait around.
                I need to find something to start just to make money: to give me that experience.
                But also, to keep building my body of work too.
                I have to be able to say look at what I've done in the past.
                It wasn't Apple 2 level stuff, but look I can do things, I can build something that makes money, join me.'
            </p><p>
                'I can see how I might get the wrong idea without the context.'
            </p><p>
                'And it really is a hard problem.
                It is like, how do I align these not-so-world-changing projects/experiences so that they compound in a way that allows me to make the jump to bigger things?
                I love the game.
                To answer your question, I'm building a business – not an amazingly great one just yet.
                But it is on the horizon.'
            </p><p>
                'Very cool man.
                Very cool.
                So are you a Windows or MacOS or Linux kinda guy?'
            </p><p>
                'Yeah I'm loving it.
                Defnitley MacOS.'
            </p><p>
                I don't think I've ever felt so heard.
            </p><p>
