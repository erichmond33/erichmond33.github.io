            <p>
                Getting what you want is not the hard part.
                Choosing what you want is.
            </p><p>
                Because the more we get, the more we realize the cost of getting.
            </p><p>
                We might try making better choices but to no avail.
                One day, we might stop choosing.
                We might realize getting isn't worth it.
            </p><p>
                But we must choose something.
                Life forces it.
                This leads to frustration.
            </p><p>
                The only liberation is to continue strategically choosing until you don't have to anymore.
                At some point, we can find a place where we can, but don't need to, choose.
            </p><p>
                Sure, we will probably still choose.
                But the outcome of our choice no longer matters - internally or externally.
            </p><p>
                Being purposely dissconnected from getting and choosing is the ultimate freedom.
            </p>
