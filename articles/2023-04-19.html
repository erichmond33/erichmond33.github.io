            <p>
            Spend 10 minutes after your college classes talking to your professors and classmates.
            This has accounted for 80% of my degree's value.
            </p><p>
            The opportunities, friends, and sense of community that results from this small amount of time is kind of wild.
            </p><p>
            When the professor is teaching you can't connect with anyone.
            So after class, I often take 10 minutes or so just to talk.
            I'm never trying to use people.
            I'm just a curious guy in a room with people who are interested in similar things as me.
            </p><p>
            College may be inefficient, but I would probably never meet these people on my own.
