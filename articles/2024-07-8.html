                The "convenience" of modern maintenance machines
            </h2>
            <p>
                I promise you wouldn't be mowing your yard every two weeks if you had to do it the old fashioned way (which is with a scythe by the way).
            </p><p>
                If the laundry machine is running five out of seven days, often with multiple loads per day, maybe we should do it by hand to remind us it is okay to wash them once a week.
            </p><p>    
                It's super easy to reuse plates and silverware for a few meals instead of doing dishes every other day.
            </p><p>    
                What's the point of making maintenance more efficient if we end up doing the same amount of work just with higher output and bloated standards?
