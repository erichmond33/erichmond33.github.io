            A few days ago, I was standing on the fifth floor of the Astate library, overlooking the busy parking lot below.
            Vehicles would enter only to snake up and down the rows of the completely full lot.
            </p><p>
            I couldn't help but think about how much congestion this causes everyday across the entire world.
            </p><p>
            From my viewpoint, it was obvious there were no empty spots.
            If only each driver had my birds-eye view, this could be fixed.
            </p><p>
            <b>Perhaps some of our own problems could be solved with a simple change of perspective, if we were so bold.</b>
            </p><p>
            A few steps back, or maybe a hundred or a thousand, could be just what we need.
            </p>
