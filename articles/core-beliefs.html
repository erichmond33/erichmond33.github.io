            <h2>
                core beliefs
            </h2>
            <p>
                I've been searching for meaning many years before I consciously realized it; over time, I've found and discarded a variety of core beliefs.
                Objective meaning doesn't seem to exist, but maybe my journey through various subjective meanings can help you find your own.
            </p><p>
                These ideas have come from many different people with some people contributing a lot and others not as much.
            </p>
            <h3>
                The very first core beliefs I found were something like: set goals, achieve them, achieve greatness, and this will give you meaning.
            </h3>
            <p>
                But then I found something harder.
            </p>
            <h3>
                My second set of core beliefs: Solve big problems to push humanity forward, and this innovation will give you meaning.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Unlike athletes and entertainers, each successful business, or successful creation of any kinda really, has its own unique story.
                There are no formulas, and in this way, making new things is much harder.
                Real innovation is always one-of-one.
                Not only was this a compelling challenge, but helping humanity along the way made this even more exciting.
            </p><p>
                Notice that even this new target was somewhat aligned with my previous beliefs too.
                I wasn't necessarily throwing them away.
                But these both have a fundamental flaw.
            </p><p>
                If we care about making the externally, extrinsically greatest thing we can, then there are only two outcomes: success and failure.
                Either it was regarded great enough by whatever external measure you are using (i.e. number of copies sold, views, likes, awards, etc), or it wasn't.
                Success or failure, it will kill you.
            </p><p>
                The most likely case for all of us is that we never sell enough copies or win enough awards to ever consider our creations successful.
                If we value this success and never get it, we won't last.
                For the few that do succeed and win awards and get lots of views or whatever, they will realize that there wasn't ever actually any meaning at the end of that road anyways â€“ try grappling with that crushing collapse of purpose, I dare you.
                And for the still fewer group that succeeds and happily drowns in the joys of attention and ego, the work will suffer, the attention will fade, and coming full circle: failure.
            </p><p>
                Extrinsic opinion kills, and in the end, only the work remains.
            </p>
            <h3>
                My current set of core beliefs: Make the subjectively, intrinsically greatest thing we possibly can, and this will give us meaning.
            </h3>
            <p>
                When the art is finished, if we can look ourselves in the eyes and truthfully confirm that we have given it our best attempt, then it is the greatest thing we possibly could have made.
                We won.
                We will last.
                And we have found meaning.
            </p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                Future set of core beliefs: ?
                We will see.
