                Why I don't post on social media
            </h2>
            <p>
                <i>It is addictive.</i>
                Not posting ensures that I'm spending my time on what I actually want, not what the algorithm wants.
                In general, a product that thrives on addiction gets a thumbs down from me.
            </p><p>
                <i>Traditional social media posts feel too self-centered, too selfish.</i>
                It feels like I'm shouting into an open room, "Look at me!"
                I don't want to waste people's time.
                I prefer to share things that could be useful.
            </p><p>
                <i>Most posts aren't a real representation of who I am.</i>
                The most significant things I do aren't Instagram material.
                I don't want likes for that one insignificant weekend trip.
                That trip is not my life nor who I am.
                It almost feels like lying.
            </p><p>
                <i>Posting takes me out of the moment.</i>
                When I am with someone, I really try to give them my attention.
                I never want to be thinking about what I might post later.
                I'd rather be fully there.
                Staying present is hard enough without any distractions.
                (Although, I do wish I took more pictures, but just for me.)
            </p><p>
                <i>I don't want my friends to feel like an accessory.</i>
                I think my Mom uses Facebook too much, but to each their own.
                However, I won't let her post very many pictures of me because I often feel like a trophy being flaunted.
                This isn't my Mom's intention of course.
                But I don't want to do the same thing and make my friends feel like I'm spending time with them for likes.
            </p><p>
                With all of these combined, I'm happier not posting.
                Anything worth sharing can be found here, on my website.
