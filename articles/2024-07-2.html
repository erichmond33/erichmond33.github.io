            <p>
                Most modern jobs are borrrinnnnggggg.
                We sit around all day fiddling with frustrating computers; every day is a struggle not to collapse into a spiraling pit of dread and despair and boreedooommmm.
                Naturally, when we get home, we want to be stimulated and entertained.
                Movies, social media, dopamine, sugar, and videos sans clothing: we want it all.
                I'm exaggerating slightly, but the point is we <i>don't</i> want to be bored.
            </p><p>    
                This feels completely backwards.
                It ought to be that we go to work to be mentally engaged, socially connected, busy, bustling, and doing something generous.
                Once we get home, this is the time where we should be bored and do more peaceful, less stimulating things such as reading, writing, one on one conversations with friends, and being aware of our own thoughts and feelings for a little while.
            </p><p>
                Both our boredom and our entertainment feel as if they are coming from the wrong places.
