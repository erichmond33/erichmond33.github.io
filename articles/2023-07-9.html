                What is fulfilling work?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The perfect work requires four things.
            </p><p>
                <i><b>#1 The product of this work must be beautiful as it can be - a true work of art.</b></i>
            </p><p>
                This will require an extreme level of care in order to ensure the product is as beautiful and great as it can be in form, function, and the story it tells.
            </p><p>
                By the very nature of art, the product is a reflection of ourself, a reflection of our taste that has been slowly curated through every experience we have ever had.
                It is a product of our existence.
            </p><p>
                This doesn't just mean painting and music either.
                Art and beauty can be found in any medium.
            </p><p>
                <i><b>#2 The work must require greatness from ourselves.</b></i>
            </p><p>
                In the pursuit of the best product we can possibly make, the work should challenge us and push the limits of our abilities.
            </p><p>
                <i><b>#3 The product of our work must be in service to other people.</b></i>
            </p><p>
                Almost anything can be for others.
                Sharing the product of our work - thus ensuring it is in service - is a top priority.
            </p><p>
                <i><b>#4 The work should be something we would do even if we never got paid or recognized for it.</b></i>
            </p><p>
                Work worth doing, is work worth doing today.
            </p><p>
            <br>
            <br>
                So next time you are thinking about what you should do with your life, consider asking these questions.
            </p><p>
                Is this art to me, and do I care enough about this work to make it as beautiful and great as I possibly can?<br>
                Is this work going to push the limits of what I'm capable of?<br>
                Is this work going to serve others, and what do I need to do to ensure it can?<br>
                Would I do this work even if I had all the money and attention I wanted, and if so, why not start today?<br>
            </p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                I used to think there was a fifth thing.
            </p><p>
                <i><b>#5 The product of the work must be innovative.</b></i>
            </p><p>
                My preferred medium is technology.
                And innovation and tech often walk hand in hand.
                However, I don't think innovation is essential to fulfilling work anymore.
            </p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                I'd like to start a company.
                As far as I know, it is the best way to work on technology.
                (My perfect work.)
                But how can I start a company if I'm not concerned with making innovative things?
            </p><p>
                I think pure taste is valuable enough to make a company successful.
                The brand, the story a company and its products tell is enough.
            </p>
