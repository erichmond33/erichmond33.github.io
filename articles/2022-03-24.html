        They have an insatiable curiosity and have experimented with a little bit of everything. When you look at their resume, you see a broad range of experience in terms of industry, technologies, and roles.
        </p>
        <p>
        Perhaps the strongest sign of an adaptomaniac is not the experience they already have but the willingness to take on any new experience.

        If you hear a developer say "Oh, no, I'm not a front end guy" or cringe at the thought of having to learn a new programming language for their next project, they are probably not an adaptomaniac.
        </p>
        <p>
        Real adaptomaniacs love to learn new things regardless of the problem domain and whether they have any experience in it.
