            <p>
                My diet is 80% unsalted black beans, milk, and homemade bread; it keeps me happy and healthy which I am very rigorous about.
                This might sounds strange, but my philosophy on nutrition is: nobody knows anything, which is a common philosophy for my life at large right now.
            </p><p> 
                The bread thing started while I was watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/outdoorboys" target="_blank">Outdoor Boys</a> Youtube channel.
                He makes his own bread while building shelters in Alaska, so I figured it was pretty convenient.
                Over time, this became a staple in my diet but would end up having more of a positive impact on others' lives than I would have thought.
            </p><p>
                Mom had been wanting to make loafs of homemade bread and seeing how much I was eating, she finally decided to give it a try.
                Turns out, making bread is really cheap, really easy, and really good.
                <b>Everyone</b> loves Mom's homemade bread, and she loves to give it away because it is so cheap and easy.
                I found it shocking that such a simple food would evoke such overwhelming positive feedback.
            </p><p>
                So much of this doesn't make sense to me.
                One, I don't understand why it feels like the common wisdom around bread is: it's bad for you â€“ I'm pretty sure it has been a key food in the human diet for thousands of years.
                Two, I don't understand why people LOVE it so much; perhaps we are so starved of any real, non-preprocessed, or junk food that simple homemade bread is a fantastic revelation in people's diets.
            </p><p>
                It makes me really happy when Mom tells me about giving a loaf to so and so and how they thought it tasted so good yet didn't make them feel tired or sluggish or bloated.
                Most food I've deemed healthy in the past doesn't get received well by the average person (black beans for example lol), so it is really cool to see a healthy food I found being evangelized by those around me.
                For my immediate friends and family, we are all one step closer to becoming happier, healthier people, and that is pretty awesome to see.
