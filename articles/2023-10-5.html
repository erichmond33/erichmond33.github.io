            </h2>
            <p>
                If a 21 year old man has a clean room, it is probably because he watches Jordan Peterson videos.
            </p><p>
                But seriously, his theory around responsibility does seem to hold some measure of truth.
                He <a href="https://youtu.be/QctT0Oc_uQQ?si=KuNEh-ZyUrvBHBwM&t=352" target="_blank">says it</a> better than I can,
                <blockquote>"Responsibility. That’s what gives life meaning. It’s like lift a load, then you can tolerate yourself right because look at you. You’re useless, easily hurt, easily killed. Why should you have any self-respect? That’s the story of the fall. Pick something up and carry it, make it heavy enough so that you can think, 'Useless as I am at least I could move that from there to there.'"</blockquote>
            </p><p>
                Looking at Peterson's growth on the internet, there is obviously something there causing sparks to fly in the minds of young men (85% of his audience).
                I feel it too.
                Yet as a person who thinks they have a decent handle on life – aside from the occasional complete and total mental breakdown – there seems to be something missing in his message.
                Sure I feel useless sometimes, but most days I feel like I'm doing life well, perhaps above average.
                I'll go a bit further.
                The responsibility Peterson often talks about: getting a job, providing for a family, maintaining friends, having hobbies, and just being an decent contribution to society, doesn't seem hard to me.
                It actually feels unmotivating and sad to aim that low.
                (And yes I can see your eyes rolling from here.)
            </p><p>
                Recently I finished Walter Isaacson's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1982181281" target="_blank">new biography on Elon Musk</a>.
                I'd read Ashlee Vance's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/006230125X" target="_blank">biography on musk</a> way back in the 10th grade and still to this day – aside from the childish Twitter drama – find Elon so inspiring.
                Who doesn't lol.
                But a few days ago it hit me; Elon's crazy missions: sustainable energy, flying rockets to Mars, etc, are Jordan Peterson's high-achiever version of the responsibility theory.
                It is like, okay so doing the normal stuff sounds easy and boring?
                Try flying a rockets.
                Try literally changing the world on a large scale.
            </p><p>
                I've known for a long time that the idea of changing the world is very appealing to me – even despite the high price attached to that.
                Crazy as I may or may not be, connecting this to Peterson's theory has been very helpful in keeping me aligned throughout the day.
                I keep in mind, yes, there is a big exciting mission that could change lives.
                But also, this mission is rote and hard and annoying just like any other responsibility is day to day.
                And I work at it piece-by-piece every single day so I can tolerate myself, so I can have a little bit of self-respect.
            </p><p>
                <i>Maybe you need to be responsible and aim higher.</i>
            </p><p>
                P.S.: For the life of me, I couldn't think of any way to write this article and not sound like some combination of a crazy, delusional narcissist or naive, light-minded child.
                Conviction, craziness, or courage?
                Idk, anyways, I hope you liked it :)
