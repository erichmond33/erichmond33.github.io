                Letting go
            </h2>
            <p>       
                Whether we consciously notice it or not, all of us are endlessly searching for the answer to Aristotle's age-old question: "How should a human being lead his life?"
                I've given this plenty of conscious thought and found things that work for me.
                But I found myself getting entrenched.
            </p><p>
                I was clinging to old ideas and skittishly attaching myself to new ones.
                Unlike the past, where I had boldly adopted new beliefs, I realized that I wasn't afraid of the new ideas but rather forgetting the old ones.
                I thought somehow I might lose myself in the pursuit of different ideas.
            </p><p>
                Everyone should write a <a href="https://bloge.li/book" target="_blank">memoir</a> or blog, even if nobody reads it.
                A great part about writing is we get to share ideas with others, sure.
                But an arguably better benefit is we store old versions of ourself on paper â€“ where it won't get lost.
            </p><p>
                Since all the important stuff is permanently cemented on those pages, we can move on with our lives.
                We can truly move forward because the hesitation and fear of forgetting something is gone.
            </p><p><i>
                Consider writing not to remember, to forget.
