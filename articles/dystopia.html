            <p>What does the world look like once the machines do everything?</p>

            <p>They will be the primary source of innovation and creativity.</p>

            <p>You will have everything in abundance.</p>

            <p>All of our problems will be solved.</p>

            <p>We won't be special anymore.</p>

            <p>There won't be any meaning beyond what we create ourselves.</p>

            <p>You could do anything.</p>

            <p><b>Do you really want all of this free time?</p>

            <p>Could you really ask yourself, "What do I want to do?"</p>

            <p>Or are you too distracted?</p>

            <p>Maybe the question is too hard?</b></p>

            <p>...</p>

            <p>The world has 8 billion people that do everything.</p>

            <p>Everyone else is the primary source of innovation and creativity.</p>

            <p>They are providing everything in abundance for almost nothing.</p>

            <p>They are solving all of the problems.</p>

            <p>You aren't that special - but surly unique.</p>

            <p>We don't know the meaning of life.</p>

            <p>You can do anything.</p>

            <p><b>Do you really want all of this free time?</p>

            <p>Could you really ask yourself, "What do I want to do?"</p>

            <p>Or are you too distracted?</p>

            <p>Maybe the question is too hard?</b></p>
