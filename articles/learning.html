                Theory vs practice
            </h2>

            <p>
            In the College of Computer Science here at Astate, there is a heavy debate about what a CS degree is for.
            Most believe it is about learning the theory behind CS.
            Others believe it is about building things with software - practice.
            </p><p>
            These two are not mutually exclusive.
            It is actually the opposite, you can't have one without the other.
            </p><p>
            We can start at either one, but we always end at the other.<br>
            <b>1) We create things because they are interesting and exciting.
            We learn what is necessary in order to create that thing.</b><br>
            <b>2) We learn theory to expand the possibilities of creation.
            We create to solidify the theory.</b>
            </p><p>
            My most efficient years of education were when I bounced between both cases purely based off what I felt like doing.
            </p><p>
            I've never had a college class with <i>too much</i> practice.
            The worst classes have always leaned too heavily towards theory.
            Perhaps the issue is something else entirely: laziness.
