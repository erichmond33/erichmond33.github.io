            </h2>
            <p>            
                We are social creatures, no doubt about it.
                Friends are a biological necessity.
                But hanging out has its challenges.
            </p><p>    
                If we are thirsty, we can go get a drink.
                However, our friends aren't always free whenever we want (or perhaps need) them to be.
            </p><p>
                For too long I would deal with this uncomfortable feeling.
                If nobody was free, tough luck.
                I would feel bad and nothing productive would get done.
            </p><p>
                One day I called my friend.
                They were busy and couldn't hang out for whatever reason.
                Ugh.
                It was alright but disappointing for sure.
                They said, "Wanna make plans?"
                We did.
                I didn't think much about it.
                And a few minutes later I found myself in a really great mood.
                This caught me off guard.
            </p><p>
                All I had to do was make plans.
            </p><p>
                Knowing that I would see my friend in a few days quenched my thirst.
                It was enough.
            </p>
