            Stop Killing Your Ideas: Jot Them Down
            </h2>
            <p>
            If you are someone who creates things it is imperative that you jot fleeting ideas down.
            </p>
            <p><b>
            Ideas don't come out fully formed.
            </b></p>
            <p>
            By jotting down any thought that is even vaguely interesting, you allow it to grow. Just trying to remember it is deliberately killing your ideas of out laziness.            </p>
            <p>
            Once the idea is safely and briefly recorded, your mind is free to be creative and follow other long rabbit holes without worry.
            </p>
            <p>
            You will be amazed at just how creative you can be, if only you would stop killing your ideas.
