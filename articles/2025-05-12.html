                Volunteer When You Are Sad
            </h2>
            <p>
                We've all been through – or perhaps are going through – a tough period in our lives.
                Things aren't going our way, life is moving slowly and painfully, activities you used to enjoy seem pointless, and there is a good chance we are somewhat lonely.
                While I can't help you speed up this period of growth, I can offer an idea that might make it just a little bit more bearable: volunteer.
            </p><p>
                Volunteering is a worthwhile remedy for a reason you may not have considered before.
                Usually non-profit organizations are helping a group of people in need, a group of people likely in a much worse situation than whatever you might be going through, and confronting their problems second-hand helps give us space and perspective about our own situation.
            </p><p>
                For example, I've had a very tough time finding work for a while, and it seems like I have very few options right now.
                I spent some time with an organization that sends donated books to those in prison; inmates write a letter, and volunteers try to fulfill their request as best they can.
                Spending just a few hours considering the lives of these individuals with literally so few options left me feeling grateful and empathetic.
                By getting some distance from our own immediate problems, we open ourselves up to the lightness we need to get through them.
            </p><p>
                Some more obvious but still valuable benefits include feeling good for helping someone and having the chance to meet and talk to new people – perhaps even someone who might open the right door at just the right moment.
                Often tough times are when we "find out who our real friends are" as the saying goes, and these good-hearted volunteers taking time out of their day to help someone in need are great people to have around us in a tough situation.
            </p><p>
                This doesn't require any long-term commitment.
                Just try it once if that's all you can tolerate.
                I understand; I'm very defensive of my time.
                But what do you have to lose?
