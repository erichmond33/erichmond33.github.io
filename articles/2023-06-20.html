            <p>
                We all have so much potential.
                Many of my peers hide the best parts of themselves.
                It is a shame.
                Every once in a while, seemingly by accident, I'll catch a glimpse of who they really are.
                For a moment, they let their guard down.
                These small sparks of personality are beautiful.
                We all should do our best to find and share who we are.
            </p><p>
                It is time to leave our high school days of dogma, cliques, and following instructions behind.
                The real world celebrates individuality, uniqueness, obsession, breaking the rules, or making a new game entirely.
                Our own path is the only path.
                We won't find fulfillment or excitement by blending into the pack any longer.
            </p><p>
                Start by listening to yourself.
                Try being present and really attentive to how things and experiences make you feel.
                Paying attention is all it takes.
                Ever so slowly, we might find a little more of ourselves.
                Thus, we might have a little more to share - something real, something you.
            </p><p>
                When exposing our thoughts, feelings, and interests we leave the door open to be attacked.
                We also leave the door open to even deeper connections and love.
                It is worth the fear and discomfort.
                Be bold and share who you are.
            </p><p>
                Go.<br>
                Listen.<br>
                Pay attention.<br>
                Feel.<br>
                Be courageous.<br>
                Share.<br>
                Smile.<br>
                Be you.<br>
            </p><p>
                If you know what you like, why is figuring out what you want so hard?
                Perhaps, you don't.
