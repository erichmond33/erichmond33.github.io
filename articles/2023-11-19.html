            <p>  
                Christmas is around the corner, and giving great gifts is extremely hard.
                We truly do want to give our loved ones something amazing, and the though of getting something bad is enough to make ya sweat.
                But I think the worst gifts aren't gifts they don't like; rather, it is unthoughtful and safe gifts.
            </p><p>
                These safe gifts are the ones that you don't hate but don't love either.
                Ya know kinda like getting underwear – like thanks?
                I'll wear these I suppose.
            </p><p>
                This Christmas I encourage y'all to take some risks.
                Try thinking of something your giftee would either absolutely love or hate.
                On one hand, you might give the best gift ever.
                But even if they hate it, this is probably a better situation than something they are impartial about.
                For one, everything is returnable these days.
                If you communicate that you were trying to go all or nothing with this gift, then they will feel better about telling you they don't like it.
                An added bonus: their spoken dissatisfaction is going to strengthen the relationship because hard conversations have that effect.
                In the end, they either have a fantastic memorable gift or the relationship strengthens and they go out and splurge on something else they wanted anyways.
            </p><p>
               There are no shortcuts to getting a great gift.
                It takes time and effort just to make a decision – then of course the money or time to get/make the thing.
                Maybe this Christmas you'll consider being brave and taking a risk on a great gift.
                I hope you all give and get something special this year.
