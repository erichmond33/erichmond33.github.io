            <h2>
                AI madness
            </h2>
            <p>
            I started learning about AI about three years ago.
            It seemed like a technology that would have a large impact, and I thought it was interesting.
            Because I love the stories of Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, or any number of people that have been the face of some fantastic achievement, I thought AI might be the technology that tells my story.
            </p><p>
            Flash forward to today, AI is taking off.
            It is everywhere.
            I used to feel like I could keep up with everything that was happening.
            I probably still could today, but it would take a toll on me.
            It would throw me out of balance.
            My grip on the industry is slipping due to the growing size.
            </p><p>
            This brings new challenges.
            I get anxious as I scroll through Twitter or my AI newsletters.
            I feel like, oh great more information to drown in, more things that I don't have time to read.
            I don't really know the best way forward.
            </p><p>
            For now I'm feeling that balance and long term persistence are best.
            Mainly for two reasons.
            One, you can't force greatness.
            You can only invite it in, and the more I <i>need</i> something the faster it seems to run from me.
            Two, I think I am more likely to fail from burnout than getting washed away by the growth.
            There will always be the next thing, the new innovation.
            However, if I am too crushed to work at all, that next thing isn't available to me.
            </p><p>
            I am open to suggestions.
            </p><p>
            I do think there will come a time when I start a business, and my working hours go way up.
            But I suspect it won't throw me off balance.
            Creating something with super smart friends is the dream.
            Here I'm talking strictly about maintaining a competence on the bleeding edge of AI.
