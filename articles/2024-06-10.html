                Shared living is great
            </h2>
            <p>
                Every single time I told a friend or family member that I would be staying in a <a href="https://brownstone.live/" target="_blank">shared-living space</a> during my move to San Francisco, they all made a comment on how awful this living situation would probably be.
                They were wrong.
            </p><p>
                In retrospect, I would have hated living in SF by myself during this past month.
                I knew exactly one person here, and he was my landlord.
                The guys in the house showed me the city and plugged me into the tech scene way faster than if I had been living alone.
                It was so nice to come home and have people to talk to because the loneliness of moving away from everyone you know is very real.
            </p><p>
                If you are moving somewhere new, I would highly suggest trying to find a place with some roommates â€“ at least in the beginning.
