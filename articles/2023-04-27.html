                Living slowly
            </h2>
            <p>
            <i>I enjoy living slowly.</i>
            </p><p>
                This feels like: peace, contentment, mental clarity, empathy and care towards others, joy, calmness, patient ambition, confidence, curiosity.
            </p><p>
                Living fast feels like: anxiety, insufficiency, brain fog, unintentional selfishness, misdirection, hurry, restless ambition, insecurity, boredom.
            </p><p>
                The pace of my clock can be steadied by the things I do.
            </p><p>
                Some slow setting activities are: reading, writing, jogging, doing nothing, being alone, working on interesting things, focusing on one thing, silence.
            </p><p>
                Some things that will speed me up are: watching tv/Youtube, social media, notifications on my phone, working on uninteresting things, being around people for long periods of time, leaving a TV or music running in the background, or staying up to date on current world affairs.
            </p><p>
                <i>Only you can figure out what speed is desirable.</i>
                I really enjoy hanging out with friends or watching a great movie just like anybody else, but the amount really matters.
                I don't want to get too sped up.
            </p><p>
                <i>Slowing down is harder than speeding up.</i>
                Reading makes you smarter and running makes you healthier.
                They both can be enjoyable, but they also suck a lot of the time.
                It is work.
            </p><p>
                <i>I live slowly because it makes me feel good.</i>
                We are our habits.
                Eating chocolate will make us feel good.
                Also, having a fit body will make us feel good.
                The difference is one takes a lot more effort to find.
