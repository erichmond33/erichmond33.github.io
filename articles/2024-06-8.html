                I love blogs; I don't love Twitter.
            </p><p>
                The intrinsic value of the text in a Tweet is usually very low.
                It isn't very creative, insightful, or worth thinking about â€“ blogs are.
            </p><p>    
                This doesn't mean Tweets are useless or worthless, but they do have a different kind of value: social value.
                It can be very beneficial to know what your people are up to right now, which might lead to serendipitous opportunities.
                The important part is making this distinction.
            </p><p>    
                We should go to the break room to check on our friends.
                We shouldn't go to the break room for a lecture on the meaning of life, and if we do, we'll likely be let down by the experience.
