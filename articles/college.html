            Stop caring about your degree: How I look at college
            </h1>
            <p>
            For most people, a degree represents the ability to follow instructions.
            They believe that trading their mission for a meaningless job, security, and money will make them happy.
            </p><p>
            I disagree.
            </p><p>
            Entire storage units of crap don't make you happy, and the security is a lie.
            Most of all, nothing is worth giving up your mission.
            </p><p>
            My <i>college years</i> should give me a higher chance to do work that is important to me.
            However, <i>the degree</i> is nearly worthless.
            </p><p>
            Today all desirable companies - ones with a purpose you believe in - ask the same thing.
            <b>What problems have you solved, what things have you built, or what teams have you led?</b>
            Only having a college degree leaves you with three answers.
            None, nothing, or I'm sorry for wasting your time.
            </p><p>
            But these questions are fantastic guidance whether you want to work for a company or start your own thing.
            Unless you are fired up to follow instructions, spend as much effort and time on those three things as possible.
            </p><p>
            This isn't a burden either.
            I don't dread starting a new project.
            It isn't extra homework that I <i>have</i> to do.
            </p><p>
            It is a chance to be useful, connect, and touch the hearts of people around me today.<br>
            It is making something that I love (and hopefully others too.)<br>
            It is fixing things that are ugly and broken.<br>
            It is passion not stress.<br>
            </p><p>
            I think we all want that, and it might be the most <a href="/articles/TheMostImportantThing">important thing</a>.
            </p><p>
            Spending as much time as I can on these things is so important to me that I don't care about my grades.
            I do good enough to pass and keep my scholarships.
            But the world barley cares about my degree, and so do I.
            </p><p>
            I treat my classes as introductions to new ideas - not vital information for the test.
            I use this new information and extra time to better fulfill <i>my mission</i>.
            </p><p>
            I would spend as much time as it takes to find yours.
