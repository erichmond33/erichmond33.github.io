                The South is judgmental
            </h2>
            <p>
                Before leaving for San Francisco, anytime I'd mention it, or more generally, California, 90% of the people here in Arkansas would have some kind of snarky, half-hearted remark about the liberals, homelessness, or homosexuals.
                Really anytime anyone does anything even remotely outside of the norms here in the South they will get teased or talked about.
            </p><p>
                I was shocked to find this was <b>not</b> the case in San Francisco.
                There are so many outliers, weirdos, and eccentrics (and I mean that in a good way) that the average person either doesn't care at all in a you-do-you kinda way or is very open minded and curious of all things.
            </p><p>
                I asked a few people if they had any strong opinions about the South similar to the ones we had about them, but they didn't.
                Some people had some opinionated views on Trump however none on southern people or culture.
            </p><p>
                Isn't the South supposed to have the stereotype of being kind and hospitable?
                Perhaps we are also incredibly judgmental.
