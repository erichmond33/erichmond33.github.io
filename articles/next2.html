                In the late 1990s, the internet was real, mostly populated by researchers and hackers (an old-school term for techy geeks not malischious infiltraitors) with no financial motives – these were the days of personal websites and forums now replaced with Facebook accounts and Twitter.
                Anything you see on the internet today is NOT real.

                The modern internet is one gaint, mostly centralized, sales funnel.
                99% of the content you read, listen, or watch is meant to pursaude or sell you a product or values, and this is especially important for those of us who go to large internet personalites for answers or advice on how to live.
                Would you take the advice of someone who isn't real?
                Let me explain...
                
                - you are being sold to
                Most posts you see on the internet are done for blatantly commercial reasons.
                Some people are very direct about this: think Andrew Tate yelling about how poor you are and how you should buy his $50 a month online course.
                Some are slightly more sneaky: think Alex Hormozi just "wanting to provide value" which is fine and probably true, but he wouldn't be sharing this free advice if it didn't have a return on investment.
                Finally some are grand masters in sales: think Elon Musk telling you whatever story he can about climate change, going to Mars, or AI taking over the world – news flash, he'll say whatever he has to for his companies to survive regardless of how true or moral it is.
                I'm not commenting on whether any of this is good or bad.
                I am telling you that you get to decide how much you wish to be sold to.

                - you are being lied to
                Almost all of the successful online male figures I admire aren't married and give very compelling reasons in favor of this.
                I found myself seriously contemplating this idea and even asking ChatGPT about some of the pros and cons before realizing how absolutely ridiculous the idea of never getting married is.
                The thought that snapped me out of this was I couldn't think of a single adult male that I knew in real life that wasn't married.
                Thus the idea: the internet isn't real.
                
                - you are being entertained
                To be entertaining is to be something more exageratted than normal life.
                




                This got me thinking about all the other things I see on the internet, and clearly most of it is a sales funnel: think about Alex Hormozi posts or Elon Musk... they are selling.
                But even the writers and podcasters and the people I respect most on the internet just can't be trusted.
                The ideas you hear on the internet aren't good representations of the way the world works for most people.
