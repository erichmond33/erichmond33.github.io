                I used to be terrified of telling people what songs I was currently listening to.
                I was afraid of being judged.
                (A self conscious teenager? 
                No way! Haha.)
                But I think this fear is fairly common.
            </p><p>
                Music is such a powerful medium.
                Unsurprisingly, sharing that takes a lot of vulnerability.
            </p><p>        
                The first person I ever shared my music taste with became one of my closest friends.
                We liked a lot of the same stuff, and it created a really strong bond between us.
                This upside completely caught me off guard.
                They also introduced me to a lot of great music too, which was also a first.
            </p><p>
                Because of that experience, these days I am quick to share what I'm listening to.
                I've been laughed at for sharing a song, but that is alright.
                The chance to really connect with someone makes it worthwhile.

                Share your music :)

                P.S. What are you listening to?
