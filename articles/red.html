            <h1>My favorite "That '70s Show" episode</h1>

            <p>In S3E12 "The Velvet Rope", Red Forman gets whipped by life. And I love it.</p>

            <p>For those of you who don't watch the show, Red is a middle class veteran in his 50s.
            He is very stubborn, arrogant, and pompous but by all means a respectable working class US citizen in the 1970s.</p>

            <p>In the previous episode, Red loses his "safe" job when the local auto parts plant shut down, but the best part comes as Red scrambles to find a new job.</p>

            <p>Here is the transcript...</p>


            <pre style="white-space: normal;font-size: 17px;"">
                <p>( Red is about to enter the waiting room for the job interview. He goes over his pitch in his head. )</p>
                <br>
                <p>Red: ( thinking ) Hi. Red Forman. Experienced, loyal, hardworking. Yeah.</p>
                <br>
                <p>( He opens the door to see his coworkers from the plant. )</p>
                <br>
                <p>Everyone: Hey!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Red: It's all you guys...from the plant, huh? So! We're all going after the same job. Well! That's uh...that's terrific!</p>
                <br>
                <p>( he sits down next to someone. )</p>
                <br>
                <p>Person: Well, I wish I had your confidence, Red. I got nothing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Red: Hm.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Person: All I could think to do was tell this guy I'm experienced, loyal, and hardworking.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Red: ( Thinking ) Son of a bitch!</p>
            </pre>

            <p>So it turns out that his reliable company wasn't so reliable, and his distinctive qualities weren't so distinctive.</p>

            <p>I don't love seeing Red - or anyone for that matter - suffer or struggle.
            However, in Red's awful misery and disarray, he will be the most susceptible to new ideas.
            He will be more open to grow and change than in his previous solidified stubborn mindset.</p>

            <p>Being wrong can be one of the most positively impactful times in your life if you are willing to grow through it.</p>
