                I had been rather lazy the past couple daysâ€”creatively speaking anyways.
                Today wasn't much different, but I had been putting off some writing for too long.
            </p><p>
                The project kept rolling around in my mind.
                At this point, I had been through about three mental rough drafts.
                Too bad those don't count.
            </p><p>
                About 30 minutes before I was set to go to the gym, I snapped and hurled out about two full pages of decent text.
                Happily, I left for the gym listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/OHnFheqTTdg?si=VrP_91Giy8FpEThA" target="_blank">Jeff Foxworthy</a> all the while.
                Comedy probably shouldn't be my go-to when lifting heavy weights above myself for two reasons: one, the obvious danger and two, nothing looks more crazy than laughing to yourself during a 225 pound bench-press.
                But hey, I was in a good mood.
            </p><p>
                I don't think this is the optimal way for me to make art.
                But sometimes the most important things won't leave us alone.
                Eventually, if we are lucky, it becomes easier to do the work than to mull on an idea any longer.
            </p><p>
                It is unpleasant to put off work we ought to do, but it happens.
                Sometimes we get sick.
