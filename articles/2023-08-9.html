                In a movie two people were reminiscing over time they had spent together before parting ways nearly a decade earlier.
                They couldn't believe neither of them exchanged phone numbers.
            </p><p>
                One person explained, <i>"It's because when you're 22 you think you're going to keep having these amazing connections all the time.
                Then you get older and realize how rare it is."</i>
            </p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                Perhaps I'm not old enough to know if there is any truth in that.
                But there seems to be.
            </p><p>
                Don't let the slow drift of life pull great people away from you.
