                Only do stuff that benefits you.
                Don't treat others with respect or kindness.
                Ask but never give.
                If it doesn't help you, why bother?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is obviously a bad long term strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wouldn't call this selfishness.
                It's actually just being dumb.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><i>In order to be truly selfish, we have to be selfless.</i></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Selfishness and selflessness are two sides of the same coin.
                You don't get one without the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                To maximize our own profit and pleasure, we should maximize the problems we solve for others.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><i>Help the most people = Reap the most benefits</i></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                However, you can't help lots of people without helping one.
                So start helping those around you first.
                Love and respect go a long way.
                Gifts are great desert.
            </p>
            <p>
                So go on and be selfish... err, I mean selfless ;)
