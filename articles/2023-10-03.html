                I'm an ex-athlete.
                After high school sports ended, I continued to play pick up basketball, tennis, ultimate frisbee, etc with my friends pretty regularly.
                I'd rather just get really good at a single sport.
                Still though, it was fun but often lacking intensity.
                People just don't take leisurely games all that serious.
            </p><p>
                Over time my friends, and probably people my age in general, started playing less and less.
                It has become harder to find people that wanna play anything.
                I rolled with the punches trying to find other ways to fill my time.
                But finally, I've accepted this isn't working for me.

                Competition is a basic need: similar to food, water, sleep, love, and expression – if you are the creative type.
                Like these other basic needs, I am happiest when there is a stable and predictable supply.
                In retrospect it seems obvious.
                I've been playing and competing since I was a child.
                I encourage all my ex-athlete peers to take note of whether you miss playing sports.
                You don't have to stop.

                Maybe this is a good time to start some kind of intramural league.
                I gave this a shot with tennis at my college, and it turns out there is already a thriving community in Jonesboro.
                I'll be playing in a tennis league here shortly :)
            </p><p>
                Competing is probably not a basic need for all people, but it might be for you.
