                Networking for your career
            </h2>
            <p>
                In San Francisco, there are tech meetups/events every single day, and people use them as serendipitous networking opportunities.
                This might not be the best way to go about it.
            </p><p>
                Leaving these events, often I'd connected with 20 people over Instagram or LinkedIn or whatever, but felt like I didn't know any of them.
            </p><p>
                My suggestion is to go get coffee for an hour with one person and really get to know what they are doing and how you can help.
                Instead of going to three events a week, get to know three people a week.
            </p><p>
                It is these stronger and more personal relationships that will benefit our careers and lives.
            </p>
