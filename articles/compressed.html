        <h2>
            Bargain with the future
            </h2>
            <p>
            The most successful people sacrifice who they are today for who they can become tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p>
            They literally bargain with the future. Fascinating.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, this lesson is useless without discipline.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
            Have higher purpose
            </h2>
            <p>
            The daily grind, no matter what you are striving for, will suck most of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
            An inspiring mission will make the day to day struggle worthwhile.
            </p>
            <p>
            So we must align ourselves with the stars. We must have higher purpose.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
            Angst? No, excitement
            </h2>
            <p>
            I need to compete. Period.
            </p>
            <p>
            I just love it so much. It is exhilarating.
            </p>
            <p>
            This isn't true for everyone, but I get a lot of energy from competition.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
            You don't know what you don't know
            </h2>
            <p>
            So learn, learn, learn.
            </p>
            <p>
            I can't say this enough.
            </p>
            <p>
            You are either learning, growing, and improving or you are dying.
            </p>
            <p>
            You show me a person who doesn't actively learn, and I'll show you mindless body.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
            Simply, leadership
            </h2>
            <p>
            There are many nuances to leadership, but there are three rules all leaders must follow to gain the respect of their peers.
            </p>
            <p>
            Rule #1: Work way harder than everyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
            Rule #2: You must be an expert in the domain you are leading, or at least be in the process of working your tail off to become one.
            </p>
            <p>
            Rule #3: You aren't too good for ANY job. Do the little things often. I.e. cleaning up, unloading, moving chairs, and things like that.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
            Be nice to everyone
            </h2>
            <p>
            More opportunities will come your way, and you will be more successful.
            </p>
            <p>
            You and those around you will be happier.
            </p>
            <p>
            You will learn so much if you genuinely listen with a good heart.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
            Be bored
            </h2>
            <p>
            Life gets so fast in a hurry.
            </p>
            <p>
            We have a million obligations and no time to figure out ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
            Surprisingly it is really hard to do nothing. TV is much easier.
            </p>
            <p>
            Nonetheless, do nothing for 30 minutes a day. I promise you will find ideas, forgotten dreams, and clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
            You will also find many buried problems, but that is a good thing.
            </p>
