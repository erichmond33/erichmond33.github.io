            <p>
                The idea that we are running towards something might not be true.
                It could be that what we are running towards is, not coincidentally, away from what we don't want.
            </p><p>
                That is, in my experience, we are much more motivated by discomfort and fear.
            </p><p>
                Maybe that successful person doesn't want it more than you do.
                Maybe not having that success is much more painful for them than it is for you.
            </p><p>
                Instead of asking, "What do I want?", it might be worth asking, "What do I <i>not</i> want?"
