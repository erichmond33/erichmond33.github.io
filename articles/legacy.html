            Pesky legacy necessity
            </h1>
            <p>
            Legacy - measured by making things better - is a noble aspiration.
            But the process is tricky.
            </p>
            <p>
            <i>If you are desperate to leave a legacy, you lose.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
            The world seems to hate needy things.
            </p>
            <p>
            People like this always feel inauthentic - always peddling themselves.
            Even their best intentions seem inconsiderate.
            </p>
            <p>
            Contentment makes you more open to smaller humbler projects.
            Finding something useful and good to do is easy, but legacy necessity will make these things feel too insignificant to invest in.
            </p>
            <p>
            Besides, nobody can plan the next path to greatness anyways.
            </p>
            <p>
            Make it easier on yourself and let go of the need to leave a legacy.
            </p>
