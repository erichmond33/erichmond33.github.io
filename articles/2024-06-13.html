                How to have an eye for good design
            </h2>
            <p>
                My friend in San Francisco told me I have very good taste in design and asked if I had any formal training in it, because he does and knows how hard good design is.
                I don't and was pleasantly surprised by his compliment.
                I'm still not sure how good I am but do care deeply about beauty and function.

                To live in a creative way (good design is a very creative endeavor), it is important to be conscious of the things we like and don't like.
                This requires working the muscle of being attentive to our senses and noting what makes us think, "Oh that is ugly" or "That is beautiful".
            </p><p>
                How many websites or apps do we interact with in a day?
                A lot right?
                Have you ever noticed which ones make you feel good?
                Which ones are frustrating to use or just plain ugly?
                What about them makes you feel good or bad?
            </p><p>
                Design starts the moment you wake up, every day, right up until the second your hands start crafting.
                Good design, good creativity starts with noticing.
