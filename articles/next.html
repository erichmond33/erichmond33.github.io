                This is part one of the providers series: Pt1 – Breaking down the history what it took to be a male provider Pt2 – What we should be doing now Pt3 – Where the modern spouse fits into all of this

                Today we look at the growing wealth gap which as providers we should be aware and conerned about.
                In the end, I draw some optimistic, counterintutive conclusions.
                Let's dive in.

                This figure shows that the rich have been getting richer, and the poor have been at best staying the same dating back to the 1950s.
                Its harder than ever to buy a home, we are able to purchase less with our money due to inflation, and it takes two paychecks to survive.
                Basiclaly TLDR the whole thing looks like a big ole pile of crap for the average American household.
                How in the world are we expected to live even a decent life going into the future?

                The first thing I noticed when looking at this graph was it only goes back to 1950... even though that feels like a long time, humanity has been around much, much longer than 75 years, and my first instinct was to find a graph that goes back further, perhaps to the birth of America at least.
                Turns out this doesn't exist.
                We didn't really start collecting this data until the 50s, so I started trying to piece together what the wealth gap has looked like through history.
                I know kings, tyrants, and caste systems were like the default system of government before democracy, and obviosuly the wealth gap there is much larger than what exists today.
                In that situation you are either a slave, a farmer/tradesman, or royalty with no ability to change your status.
                Okay so modern times are definitley better than that.
                Let's fast-forward to the early industrail revoution in America roughly 1800-1850s.
                These were the days of your John Rockefellers and Andrew Carnegies.
                Based on the information I could pull from Google about this time period, the wealth gap was pretty freaking huge back then too.
                It was not the easy-going 1960s or what I imagine to be the nice white-picket-fence life of suburnban American.
                Things were tough.
                They worked long and hard just to get by, and it took a smart, frugal man to get ahead and thrive rather than survive.
                It is this thought that made me come to the conclusion that this comfortable period depicted in the graph is actually the exception not the rule.
                <i>Throughout all of human history, life his been a serious struggle, and it would be unreasonable to think our lives would be any different.</i>

                This counterintuitive conclusion had me digging into what jobs the average person had during the 1950s-1990s.
                I was curious what even was worth a normal salary back then, and the answer is most men worked in manufacturing factories.
                They were mostly stamping car parts and working assembly lines.
                This wealth equality was brought on by legislative acts rather than some sudden increase in the value of physcial labor, and it is this lifestyle of working for a large company, clocking your hours, and not having to worry too much about your future that has lasted all the way to present day.
                When I think of the average working man today, this is what I think of; although, China does all the manufacturing these days and the average American male sells insurance.
                To me this modern lifestyle seems to be some really boring fairytail that is quickly ending.
                We are returning to a lifestyle and culture that prioritizes momentum over comfort.

                ...

                Coincedentally Peter Theil has a stagnation hypothesis that ties very closely to the timeline in our graph from before that are also measured in an economalcally similar way.
                His hypothesis is paraphrased:

                <blockquote>
                    It was in some ways a claim about how the velocity had slowed. It wasn’t zero, but 1750 to 1970 — 200-plus years — were periods of accelerating change. We were relentlessly moving faster: The ships were faster, the railroads were faster, the cars were faster, the planes were faster. It culminates in the Concorde and the Apollo missions. But then, in all sorts of dimensions, things had slowed. [...]

                    I always made an exception for the world of bits, so we had computers and software and internet and mobile internet. And then the last 10 to 15 years you had crypto and the A.I. revolution. [...]

                    [How is this measured?] What are your living standards compared to your parents? If you’re a 30-year-old millennial, how are you doing versus when your boomer parents were 30 years old? How were they doing at the time?
                </blockquote>

                His stagnation thesis has always intrigued me, and I find it so interesting that at around the same time he thinks this stagnation really started is around the same time that our wealth inequallity starts to grow.
                What I'm not saying is if we pick up our scientific and technological progress that wealth inequality will go down again because I do believe that only happened due to legislation, but what I do think this represents is a fundamentaly shift in the culutre of what a man is expected to do and be in order to ensure the future prospeirty of his family.
                Before the comformt period and what I would consider the modern work-life, I believe it was better understood that a man was had to be smart, networked, frugal, and own things that appreciate or else hard times would fall upon him and his family whereas today we want to have zero-skill pushing a button for 8 hours, come home to relax into watching TV alone, and buy expensive crap we don't need.
                I agree the latter sounds like a very comfortable life, but the former is what we were meant to do as human beings – a species that prioritized momentum because momentum keeps us from going extinct.
                If your employer is going to take care of your future, why bother doing it yourself?

                ...

                To put a nice bow on this, I think the comfort period of the 1950s - 1970s were a ridiculs fantasty world were men could stop being men and they did.
                As a result, things stopped progressing, and we are feeling the wrath of that today.
                The wealth gap growing is a kick in the ass that we are going to have to pick up our responsiblity as men to be extremely capable and virtious just to survive which reminder, is how all of human history has been.
                We have to stop valuing comfort and stablity so much because it doesn't exist.
                We should start valuing momentum more.

                In part 2, 













                Why Wealth Inequality Being At An All-time High Is Okay

                If you live in America, you are probabliy familiar with the issue of the ever growing wealth gap along with stagnating wages and crazy inflation threatning to make it near impossible to live a decent life in the future.
                For men especially we are meant to be providers, and this long-term threat certainly concerns me; however, I've come to the conclusion that this is not a problem rather the default state of the world throughout history.
                Beyond that, I think the American Dream is certainly still alive and now is as good a time as any to live and thrive.
                It won't come easy, but as we will discuss, it never has.

                Notice this graph only starts in the 1950s.
                I started think about all the human history that happened before then... half of America's lifespan isn't included, and certainly not all of the previous civilizations that were ruled primarly by kings.
                I think we are clearly more equal than caste systems were you were either a slave, worker, or royaly, so let's fast forward to early America and roughly the birth of the corperation.
                In the 1850s, things were NOT equal.
                Figures like Rockefeller and Carnagie dominated the economy and the wealth gap was huge, and it wasn't until the early to mid 90s than legislation stepped in to create our equal world of the mid to late 90s that we see in the graph.
                Put another way, I think it is unrelastic to think the period of 1950-1980 could ever be the norm – throughout all of history, there has been a wealth gap and this graph shows an exception and not the rule.
                Argue whatever way you'd like about whether this is good or bad or whatever, but know as men it is pragmatic to see the world as it is and deal with it.
