                Throughout all of human history, the default setting for societal government has been tyranny, and it is absolutle foolishness to assume that this isn't the case no and won't continue to be in the future.
                As an free blooded American you might ask what tyranny looks like, to which I respond look around!
                The system you live in is the most clever and complex form of oppression the world has ever seen.
                We work jobs were we aren't valued, marry into relationships were we aren't respected, take on more debt than we can afford, and own nothing.
                We can afford the most sophisticated technology on the planent but not groceries and medical bills.
                This is the American Dream?
                Behind the white picket fence is a man waving with cheer while simultaniously every cell in his body aches with an existential pain as he slowly, mournfully dies a most vicious death.

                America wasn't always like this.
                There was a period roughly from 1950-1970 were wealth inequality was at record lows, and this is the world our parents grew up in.
                It is no wonder they cling to values and strategies that worked well in their early careers, but the old becomes the new and if we are to thrive instead of merely scrape by, we must have a fundemental shift in our individual values or else live in the perfect slavery that is modern consumer culture.
                The cards are stacked against us of course, and I wish it weren't so; however, this was the life of our ancestors – cruel and unfair is normal – and I have the upmost optimism that we can rekindle our human spirit.
                This is a guide to help find our way back to the lifestyles that produced strong men and capable people.
                It will surely be incomplete, but one step outside our docile nature and into the wilderness that is really living must be better than none.

                #1 Life sucks and it is your responsibility to bear it
                We've grown up in a world where our parents had nice jobs and got along with almost no struggle or pain.
                Their lives were not so grand, but the country make a promise to take care of its citizens and for awhile, it did.
                <i>This is not the world we live in today.</i>
                Your employer and your country will beat you to your knees in a heartbeat.
                They do not care about you and want your money – consumer society is built on capital not labor.
                Your labor is not valued; your networth is.
                This has a whole slew of downstream effects that we will cover in the coming sections, but the point now is we can no longer afford to assume that things will be okay unless you are extremely virtous and capable beyond your ability to move boxes from one place to another for eight hours a day.
                God only knows how ridiculously useless you currently are, and this has to change albeit one step at a time because it is hard to be useful and smart and strong and dedicated and all the other virtues that will keep you alive including just being a good person – that's a great start.
                For most people, this is anxiety inducing and scary.
                It is; that's life.
                Welcome.

                #2 If it is addicting, stop doing that thing
                In a modern world where the strict values of religion have largly been fading, the average man has succum to many addictions and vices that must be overcome if he is to be the man capable of escaping slavery.
                This could be any of the following: food, alcohol, porn, social media, video games, TV, etc.
                There should be a zero or near zero tolerance for these kinds of things.
                Nobody can really draw the line on how much is too much for you, but as long as you are always conscious and trying to limit use as much as we can, we'll be moving in the right direction.
                These various additions build up to be death by 1000 paper cuts.
                Having a decent struggle with each one cumulates into a significant struggle and burden on our lives.
                Being 10% fatter, 10% more drunken, and doom-scrolling 10% more than we should adds up to be 30% below our best, most optimal selves.
                There is so much more you left on the table if we start substracting before adding.
                If you can start to manage the horrible, flawed being you are, then we might be able to put a finger out to try and help someone or something else without absolutley wrecking it.

                #3 You've got to make friends and care about people
                One of the most clever effects of consumer capitalism is that it turns the common man against his community and peers.
                In a consumer socitey, your worth becomes tied to the things you own and the amount of money you make, and everything just becomes a gaint competition.
                This can be seen in the fall of labor unions, or the fact that the number one criteria for women considering a partner is whether or not he earns more than her.
                We aren't culturally encouraged to come together because we aren't on the same team anymore – that's kind of the definition of competition.
                I'm not sure if we should or can ever get back to a labor-based society rather than capital-based, but whatever direction we'll need to move, it'll have to be done together.
                We need to be plugged into our community and sacrifice for them every single day.
                We need to call and check in on people.
                We need to get out of the house and commune together soley for the goal of seeing other people, our people.
                It's uncomfortable and difficult and a pain in the rear to figure it all out and make it happen and so much easier to stay at home and consume on a screen, but this is important.
                If you give, give, give with no expectations of getting anything in return, counterintutivley you'll recieve ten fold.

                #4 You've got to have skills and work
                Yes, even with whatever skills you have, your labor has very little value, but it is all we've got.
                Before we can start getting ahead with investing and owning we must develope serious skills and work hard.
                The good news is that having a large and polished toolkit is an absolute neccissity for managining capital properly anyways.
                This is why lottery winners often lose their money – they lack the capability to keep it!
                In order to get paid for your skill, we need to develop only one very deeply.
                This is where you see college students spending four years just to learn one thing like accounting or law, but this is not enough for us to escape slavery.
                A capable man is capable and knowledgable across many skills which are valueable.
                You must be both a generalist and a specialist.
                Be constantly learning and applying new skills <i>as you need them.</i>
                A skill learned for no reason at all is not a skill learned.
                If you need to keep records for a small business you are trying to start, utilize free reasources to learn the basics of double-entry accounting.
                You won't be an expert, but you'll be good enough and more capable than you were before.
                Your small business will need to sell something, so you better learn how to sell along the way too.
                A skill like selling or writing is never mastered, and you'll be constantly sharpening it throughout your life.
                Use these skills and work hard... when it is your life you are working on, there is no time clock to punch.
                Your work and life will blend, and you'll start to find fulfillment from your work in a way you might never have thought possible.
