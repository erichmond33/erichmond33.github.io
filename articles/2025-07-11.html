            </h2>



            <p>
                As a developer, I'm constantly finding new ways to make me more efficent on my computer which is really imporant for everyone in 2025 given the amount of time we spend on them.
                While my list of optimizations is very long, there are some simple keyboard changes that offer large increases in comfort/productivty without much effort.

                As a reminder, this is the Mac keyboard layout with a legend to avoid confusion about which keys I'm referring to in this article.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Better Arrow Keys
            </h3>
            <p>
                Problem: Arrow keys are too far far from home row

                Solution: Map arrow keys to j, k, l, and h when holding right command.


                Holding <b>right command</b> and pressing <b>h, j, k, l</b> translates to <b>left arrow key, down arrow key, up arrow key, and right arrow key.</b>

                If you move around text a lot, quickly you'll find that using the keyboard is much faster than a mouse.
                You'll also find yourself constantly sliding your right hand back and fourth to the arrow keys and back to the jkl; keys.

                It will take a little while to get used to if you don't use VIM (you don't), but you'll pick up on it pretty quickly and it is amazing.

            <h3>
                Better Backspace And Forward Delete
            </h3>
            <p>
                The backspace button isn't super hard to reach, but it could be easier.
                For whatever reason, I've never used the right shift button – for capatlizing every character I use the left shift.
                So one day I mapped backspace to my right shift button which is much better.

                Conviently, the Mac keyboard doesn't include a dedicated forward delete button – I would bet most Mac users don't know it is control + backspace.
                But now that our orginal backspace button is moved, I replaced it with forward delete.
                Much better.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Better Control And Escape
            </h3>
            <p>
                I learned this mapping from hardcore unix guys, but I've also added onto it a bit.
                They said map left control to the caps lock key which is a good start.
                I included turning the caps lock into escape when you click it but left control when you hold it.
                Again, escape is a cruicial key the better you get a using a keyboard to navigate your computer, so it needed to be more accessable.

                Another less extreme but nice change is swapping the fn and left control keys.
                Switching tabs on a vareity of apps requires control + tab, and on a Mac, this is a litte easier if the control key is in the corner.

                I hope this also serves as a fun reminder that you can change things.
                Just remember, the hard part about making things better isn't in the creation or fixing of a problem; it is noticing it in the first place.

                (I use <a>karabiner</a> – Mac only – to make these changes.
                I'd love to help you get this set up if you aren't super techy – just email me.
                I'm sure there is a similar app for Windows, but I am not sure what that is.)
