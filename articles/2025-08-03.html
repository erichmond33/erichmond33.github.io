                We all know how hard it is to get a really great gift for someone, but here is a tip...
            </p>
            <p>
                Every really great gift I've ever given was found months in advance through serendipity – seeing something randomly while scrolling through social media or watching a video and recognizing that a person in my life would love that. I'm not sure if this is something you can train... this noticing without actively looking for gifts.
            </p>

                For me, I just got to a point where Christmas was so painful and embarrassing that it just started happening – which I have no idea what to make of. I've already got a few things bookmarked for this upcoming Christmas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe caring a little bit more about wanting to give something nice is a part of growing up. Maybe not giving something nice ruins the receiving of something nice as we get older.
