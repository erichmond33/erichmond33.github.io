            <p>
                The downsides of confidentiality might not be considered as much as they should.
                When the people involved in a project can't talk about what they are working on, the secrecy causes inadvertent problems.
            </p><p>
                Government projects seem to hastily put shields up around their work.
                There can be good reasons for this but consider the cons.
            </p><p>
                When nobody can know what a project is, progress is only measured internally.
                This lack of outside accountability causes inefficiency to run wild.
                If the project funding is taxpayer money too, there is no significant financial risk either, only making things worse.
            </p><p>
                Since you can't tell your friends and family what you are doing, there is a lack of recognition.
                Also, since the leaders can't sell the public on this idea, the project won't be able to attract the best talent an otherwise open project would.
                Nothing kills our motivation to work like being overlooked and working with half-rate employees.
            </p><p>
                The ethical standards can start to degrade as well.
                Without information the public can't check the government's actions.
                Aside from an abuse of power, an environment where this is accepted will cause good hearted people to leave.
                Culture rot will slowly ensue.
            </p><p>
                I'm not informed enough to decide whether a project should be confidential or not.
                But have the conversation.
                Don't assume there are no downsides to unnecessary secrecy.
