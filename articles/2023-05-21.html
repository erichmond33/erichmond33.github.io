                Taste is everything
            </h2>
            <p>
                Engineering or picking guitar strings used to be necessary and important.
                Today, all creative skills are quickly becoming irrelevant.
            </p><p>
                Before, there was no other way to bring new creative ideas to life.
                We had to have skill.
                But now AI can churn out an endless amount of paintings, stories, and soon - everything.
                Skills are quickly going away.
                Only our perspective is left.
                Our voice, our story, our filter, our taste.
                That is where the value lies.
            </p><p>
                Soon we all will be painters, musicians, writers, engineers, animators, film makers, game designers, and whatever else we wish to be - no skills required.
            </p><p>
                What will you build now that AI handles the execution?
                After all, your taste is everything.
            </p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                It will take more time for AI to catch up to some things.
                Running a business is a difficult creative task.
                But it will happen.
            </p><p>
                Maybe by that point AI will have its own taste.
                Maybe we will be competing with something we can't beat.
                Something we struggle to even understand.
            </p><p>
                I'm not sure what happens then.
                But I'm optimistic it will be beautiful.
            </p>
