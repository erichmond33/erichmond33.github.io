                AI angst
            </title>

<h2></h2>
<p>
                AI is everywhere, and it is scary.
                Even the godfathers of AI like Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton have expressed their anxiety.
                So no, you are not alone.
                However, recently I have found <i>some</i> peace with the whole thing.
                Maybe my thoughts will bring you some solace as well.
            </p><p>
                First of all I need to split this AI anxiety into two categories.
            </p><p>
                #1 is a fear of AI being evil or being used for evil.
                Here we are referring to the immortal dictator that enslaves humans or the normal dictators that could turn the world into George Orwell's 1984 by using this tech.
            </p><p>
                #2 is a fear of lost purpose.
                Here I'm referring to some existential questions that we must seriously consider.
                What does it even mean to be human in world where AI is smarter than everyone?
                How do we come to grips with the idea that we aren't special anymore?
                What do we do with ourselves when we don't have to work anymore?
                What do we do with ourselves when we are useless in comparison to our AI counterparts?
            </p><p>
                So what do I think?
            </p>
<h3>#1 Fear of evil</h3>
<p>
                This doesn't not give me any angst whatsoever.
                Okay maybe a little, but no more than any other new technology.
                We have always had to remain vigilant that new tech doesn't skew towards evil.
                Each new thing brings its own unique challenges, but this is simply a matter of courage.
                Let's buck up, do the work, and go boldly forward.
                In fact, I'm more afraid of stagnation than the potential evils of AI.
            </p>
<h3>#2 Fear of lost purpose</h3>
<p>
                I'm pretty sure we are just machines.
                I don't know this for a fact, and I'm not here to persuade anyone either.
                But the more these transformer language models - like chatGPT - advance, the more I feel like a simple biological machine without anything magical or special going on inside.
            </p><p> 
                If biological humans aren't all that special and we are both just machines, why be so anxious?
                They are just the next step up in machinery.
                AI isn't us, but we are the stepping stone that led to them.
                We would be arrogant and ignorant to assume we are the best possible version of ourselves.
                And I'm hopeful that they can be better than us.
                That is a good thing right?
                Being better?
                Why be so caught up with the idea that our specific configuration of flesh and bones must do the job?
            </p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                I do think it is a possibility that we could augment ourselves to remain useful.
                But here I'm considering the worse case scenario.
                Because if we can be at peace with the absolute worst case, anything less is manageable.
            </p><p>
                I'm sure my ideas on this topic will grow and change over time, but for now, this about covers it.
            </p><p>
                What are your thoughts?
                Is this helpful?

                This feels (mostly) right

<p>
                I wanted to document what my life is like during my time here at East Carolina University this summer for my REU program.
                The balance I've struck here has me feeling really good.
                So this could be useful to have in the future if I find myself feeling sub par.
                Maybe it could be helpful for you too.
            </p>
<h3>Work:</h3>
<p>
                We have a little less than a 40 hour work week.
                I'm working by myself on a project that I thought of and am implementing all on my own.
                It has been very fulfilling.
                I also don't feel like I'm working so much that other aspects of my life are being neglected which has not always been true with other forms of work.
            </p><p>
                I might could find a little more satisfaction if I were working on something with more future potential.
                I don't think I will take this research any further once I am done.
                So having something that could grow into my wildest dreams could make the work better.
                Working with a team could also be better.
                I'm in the room with everyone else during the week, but we are all doing our own thing.
                If my situation incorporated these two things, I could probably work many more hours each week and still maintain my health.
            </p>
<h3>Health:</h3>
<p>
                I'm getting 45 minutes worth of cardio/gym time about 5 days a week.
                Wednesday I attend an AI journal club where we read papers and Friday the gym closes too early for me to get there.
                For food I am getting about 2500 calories.
                Overall, I don't think my health is getting worse, and I don't feel bad.
                Earlier in the summer I tried to cut out sweets, but I found myself craving them late at night.
                This was very distracting.
                Now I usually have 2 or 3 chocolate chip cookies for lunch and that has helped.
            </p><p> 
                The only thing I would change here is getting better quality food.
                Subway and cafeteria food aren't a long term solution despite being my only options here.
            </p>
<h3>Friends:</h3>
<p>
                I generally hang out with people twice a week on Friday night and Saturday during the day.
                This has been the perfect amount for me.
                I still have plenty of me time, but knowing I will have something fun to do twice each weekend has been great.
                Having people that share many interests with me has also been fantastic.
                I love talking about AI, companies, computers, books, and other somewhat technical things and so do a lot of the people here.
            </p><p> 
                Having people so readily available to hang out during the week has been somewhat distracting though.
                There isn't much time in the day after we get out of work.
                And I like to spend it doing things for me.
                Some days I find myself wasting a bit more time than I'd like just hanging out.
            </p>
<h3>Housing:</h3>
<p>
                Living on my own has also been terrific.
                I do have a roommate.
                But we don't bother one another almost at all, which is good.
                It is always quiet - unlike home.
                I have almost no stuff with me and that is nice too.
                Our room has a patio outside the window.
                And given the perfect bug-less 75 degree temps, I love going out there to hang out on the roof.
            </p>

<blockquote>
                "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation"
                <br/>
                - Henry David Thoreau
            </blockquote>
<p>
                This quote is referring to the people who are living empty lives due to unfulfilling work and too little freedom.
                However, nobody wakes up and says, "Ah yes. Today I'd like to find some meaningless work and a boss that won't let me go to the bathroom without pulling out a stopwatch."
                People never purposely decide to live poorly.
                So how do they fall into a life like this?
            </p><p>
                Have you ever been scrolling through a website on your phone and the text is way too big?
                You can change that.
                Have you ever been annoyed by the distracting ads and pop ups on every single page?
                You can change that.
                What about those websites that don't support dark mode and burn your eyeballs late at night?
                You can change that.
                Literally every single thing about your internet experience can be altered however you would like.
                Yet many people fuss with their phone in quiet desperation.
            </p><p>
                Often people live their lives the same way they interact with the internet.
                They take whatever situation the world hands them without question.
                Most of the time, the situation they are handed is purely random - a roll of the dice.
                If the odds put them in a tough position, so be it.
                Their job was an opportunity that just so happened to be available when they needed it.
                They never left their hometown because they just so happened to be born there.
                There are endless examples like this.
                Yet despite the ability to change everything, they don't.
            </p><p>
                We are the only thing in the known universe whose wants are unbounded.
                And almost anything we want, we can change.
                <b>Push, poke, prod, and will things into existence.
                It is our gift, and we should use it.</b>

<h2></h2>
<p>
                The perfect work requires four things.
            </p><p>
<i><b>#1 The product of this work must be beautiful as it can be - a true work of art.</b></i>
</p><p>
                This will require an extreme level of care in order to ensure the product is as beautiful and great as it can be in form, function, and the story it tells.
            </p><p>
                By the very nature of art, the product is a reflection of ourself, a reflection of our taste that has been slowly curated through every experience we have ever had.
                It is a product of our existence.
            </p><p>
                This doesn't just mean painting and music either.
                Art and beauty can be found in any medium.
            </p><p>
<i><b>#2 The work must require greatness from ourselves.</b></i>
</p><p>
                In the pursuit of the best product we can possibly make, the work should challenge us and push the limits of our abilities.
            </p><p>
<i><b>#3 The product of our work must be in service to other people.</b></i>
</p><p>
                Almost anything can be for others.
                Sharing the product of our work - thus ensuring it is in service - is a top priority.
            </p><p>
<i><b>#4 The work should be something we would do even if we never got paid or recognized for it.</b></i>
</p><p>
                Work worth doing, is work worth doing today.
            </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
                So next time you are thinking about what you should do with your life, consider asking these questions.
            </p><p>
                Is this art to me, and do I care enough about this work to make it as beautiful and great as I possibly can?<br/>
                Is this work going to push the limits of what I'm capable of?<br/>
                Is this work going to serve others, and what do I need to do to ensure it can?<br/>
                Would I do this work even if I had all the money and attention I wanted, and if so, why not start today?<br/>
</p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                I used to think there was a fifth thing.
            </p><p>
<i><b>#5 The product of the work must be innovative.</b></i>
</p><p>
                My preferred medium is technology.
                And innovation and tech often walk hand in hand.
                However, I don't think innovation is essential to fulfilling work anymore.
            </p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                I'd like to start a company.
                As far as I know, it is the best way to work on technology.
                (My perfect work.)
                But how can I start a company if I'm not concerned with making innovative things?
            </p><p>
                I think pure taste is valuable enough to make a company successful.
                The brand, the story a company and its products tell is enough.
            </p>

                Crushing children's dreams
            </title>
            <published>2023-07-02T00:00:00Z</published>
            <content type="html">
                <section id="article">
<h2></h2>
<p>
                Some kids are dreamers.
                Though, on the road from childhood to adults, almost everyone stops dreaming.
            </p><p>
                We can probably all remember (or imagine) the first time we nervously shared a big dream with our parents, teachers, or another adult only to be scoffed at, not taken seriously, or told some watered down version of "You can't do that".
                It was a gut punch.
                It hurt.
                It was frustrating and unexpected.
                Who are they to make that call?
            </p><p>
                In my case, sometimes my parents and teachers were supportive with their words, but when it came time for them to step up, their actions didn't match.
                I didn't understand.
                I was angry.
                Sure the things I wanted to do were unusual, uncomfortable, and likely to fail, but that was the cost of admission.
                Why wouldn't my biggest supporters believe in me?
                I felt crazy.
            </p><p>
                This led me to believe modern education needed to be reformed and tailored to all the creative dreamers out there.
                They were the ones pushing everyone forward, so why are so many of their dreams getting crushed as children?
                It was wrong and needed to be fixed.
                Turns out, I was wrong.
                Nothing was broken in the first place.
            </p><p>
                We should replace Chief Executive Officer with Chief Executive Punching-bag.
                An entrepreneur's job title is to get told "No. You are crazy." over and over and over by potential investors, employees, and customers.
                Every single day feels like the gut punch from childhood.
                For most people, starting a company makes no sense.
                It requires enduring extreme pain for a very risky potential payoff.
                So why is anyone an entrepreneur?
            </p><p>
                Simple.
                <i>They can't live without it - they have no other choice.</i>
                True entrepreneurs are going to do what they do regardless of any advice or discouragement.
            </p><p>
                Dreaming of any kind is no different.
                It is hard.
                And seemingly the whole world is against the dream.
                For most people is it easier to stop dreaming than to pursue whatever it is.
                So they do.
                It doesn't take long either and is nobody's fault.
                There is nothing wrong with it.
                It was going to happen eventually.
                <i>They could live without it.</i>
</p><p>
                Of course I'm all for giving children endless love and support for their dreams.
                I would rather have people fail as adults than be discouraged as children.
                But in some cases, the world doesn't work that way, and it might be okay.
            </p><p>
                For those who <i>have no other choice</i> - I'm talking to you, dreamers - y'all will have to fight like hell every single day to keep that spark alive.
                But I'm excited for you.
                Keep dreaming - as if you even have a choice ;)

                What do <i>you</i> like?
            </h2>
<p>
                We all have so much potential.
                Many of my peers hide the best parts of themselves.
                It is a shame.
                Every once in a while, seemingly by accident, I'll catch a glimpse of who they really are.
                For a moment, they let their guard down.
                These small sparks of personality are beautiful.
                We all should do our best to find and share who we are.
            </p><p>
                It is time to leave our high school days of dogma, cliques, and following instructions behind.
                The real world celebrates individuality, uniqueness, obsession, breaking the rules, or making a new game entirely.
                Our own path is the only path.
                We won't find fulfillment or excitement by blending into the pack any longer.
            </p><p>
                Start by listening to yourself.
                Try being present and really attentive to how things and experiences make you feel.
                Paying attention is all it takes.
                Ever so slowly, we might find a little more of ourselves.
                Thus, we might have a little more to share - something real, something you.
            </p><p>
                When exposing our thoughts, feelings, and interests we leave the door open to be attacked.
                We also leave the door open to even deeper connections and love.
                It is worth the fear and discomfort.
                Be bold and share who you are.
            </p><p>
                Go.<br/>
                Listen.<br/>
                Pay attention.<br/>
                Feel.<br/>
                Be courageous.<br/>
                Share.<br/>
                Smile.<br/>
                Be you.<br/>
</p><p>
                If you know what you like, why is figuring out what you want so hard?
                Perhaps, you don't.
            </p>

                My creativity experiment
            </title>

<h2></h2>
<p>
                Every day during my spring semester I headed to The Den at 5:30am.
                If anyone asked, it was my office.
                But in reality it was a 10x10 storage unit I had rented out.
                Inside was a desk, a chair, and a small heater.
            </p><p>
                I wanted to explore what creativity was without any preconceived notions about it.
                For that I needed a quiet, consistent, and safe place to focus.
            </p><p>
                I didn't want any expectations as to how my hours would be spent each day.
                My only rule was that I couldn't distract myself.
                For example, sitting in silence and allowing my mind to wander was fine, but I couldn't watch YouTube or scroll through Instagram.
                Often I'd make music, write, program, draw, or use any creative medium that seemed interesting.
                I never had any plans or projects I had to finish.
                All I wanted to do was to put in my 3 hours of creativty and see what happens.
            </p><p>
                I feel like I learned a lot about myself, even though that is hard to quantify.
                Working with so many different mediums also taught me that all creative work feels the same day to day.
                Before I thought I could never be a musician because it wouldn't be intellectually stimulating enough compared to engineering.
                I was dead wrong.
                The grind of making music day to day is just as difficult and exciting.
            </p><p>
                However, the long term significance a project holds is different.
                Think about building rockets or making the next hit video game.
                The long term fulfillment of these two things will vary a lot between people - they carry different amounts of significance based on the person.
                But the day to day grind will feel very similar.
                Each will have similarly compelling problems to overcome on a short enough timescale.
            </p><p>
                This is important because we can get lost in the grind of someone else's mission.
                Day to day we might be stimulated and intrigued but over the long term we aren't pursuing what would bring us more fulfillment and satisfaction.
            </p><p>
                What could you contribute to the world over a 10 year period?

                Crazy or courageous?
            </title>

<h2></h2>
<p>
                A few key moments will define us.
                I've noticed when I'm faced with these impactful decisions, there have been two choices: normal or crazy.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice is almost always blatantly harder, requiring more work, consistency, and creativity.
                But also this route forces us to go against the grain of social convention.
                This causes friction with friends, family, bosses, committees, etc.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice hurts so good.
                The pain is immense.
                But the satisfaction is too.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice requires humility.
                It could be, well - crazy.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice will reveal our friends.
                Some people won't stick around when we go our own way.
                But the relationships that hold up become stronger.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice is scary/exciting.
                It requires us to put something on the line.
                We could publicly fail.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice often minimizes regret.
                We can always be normal.
                The window for crazy can be fleeting.
            </p><p>
                The crazy choice might be the courageous choice.
                Most of the time choosing crazy has turned out great for me, far greater than the normal choice.
                Next time you are feeling a lot of opposition, consider that you might not be crazy.
                Maybe you are being courageous.
            </p><p>
                We need your courage.
            </p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                To my friends and family that have put up with my craziness over the years, Thank You :)

                Taste is everything

<p>
                Engineering or picking guitar strings used to be necessary and important.
                Today, all creative skills are quickly becoming irrelevant.
            </p><p>
                Before, there was no other way to bring new creative ideas to life.
                We had to have skill.
                But now AI can churn out an endless amount of paintings, stories, and soon - everything.
                Skills are quickly going away.
                Only our perspective is left.
                Our voice, our story, our filter, our taste.
                That is where the value lies.
            </p><p>
                Soon we all will be painters, musicians, writers, engineers, animators, film makers, game designers, and whatever else we wish to be - no skills required.
            </p><p>
                What will you build now that AI handles the execution?
                After all, your taste is everything.
            </p><p>
                ...
            </p><p>
                It will take more time for AI to catch up to some things.
                Running a business is a difficult creative task.
                But it will happen.
            </p><p>
                Maybe by that point AI will have its own taste.
                Maybe we will be competing with something we can't beat.
                Something we struggle to even understand.
            </p><p>
                I'm not sure what happens then.
                But I'm optimistic it will be beautiful.
            </p>

                Getting and choosing
            </title>

<p>
                Getting what you want is not the hard part.
                Choosing what you want is.
            </p><p>
                Because the more we get, the more we realize the cost of getting.
            </p><p>
                We might try making better choices but to no avail.
                One day, we might stop choosing.
                We might realize getting isn't worth it.
            </p><p>
                But we must choose something.
                Life forces it.
                This leads to frustration.
            </p><p>
                The only liberation is to continue strategically choosing until you don't have to anymore.
                At some point, we can find a place where we can, but don't need to, choose.
            </p><p>
                Sure, we will probably still choose.
                But the outcome of our choice no longer matters - internally or externally.
            </p><p>
                Being purposely dissconnected from getting and choosing is the ultimate freedom.

                Every night before you go to sleep grab a towel and soak a corner of it in cold water.
            </p><p>
                Gently wash your whole face.
            </p><p>
                You can't have too much or too cold of water.
                So it is better to overdo it.
            </p><p>
                That's all.
                Forget the expensive face washes and creams.
                Do this without skipping.
            </p><p>
                My face is considerably clearer.

                Just make plans

<p>            
                We are social creatures, no doubt about it.
                Friends are a biological necessity.
                But hanging out has its challenges.
            </p><p>    
                If we are thirsty, we can go get a drink.
                However, our friends aren't always free whenever we want (or perhaps need) them to be.
            </p><p>
                For too long I would deal with this uncomfortable feeling.
                If nobody was free, tough luck.
                I would feel bad and nothing productive would get done.
            </p><p>
                One day I called my friend.
                They were busy and couldn't hang out for whatever reason.
                Ugh.
                It was alright but disappointing for sure.
                They said, "Wanna make plans?"
                We did.
                I didn't think much about it.
                And a few minutes later I found myself in a really great mood.
                This caught me off guard.
            </p><p>
                All I had to do was make plans.
            </p><p>
                Knowing that I would see my friend in a few days quenched my thirst.
                It was enough.

                Let your body decide
            </title>
            <published>2023-05-11T00:00:00Z</published>
            <content type="html">

<p>
                So you have a project idea in mind.
                It is exciting, but you don't know if it worth pursuing.
                Perhaps you have tried starting, but the work is awfully strenuous.
                Still, it has potential.
                Do you choose to keep looking or commit to this idea?
            </p><p>
                Maybe we should let our body decide for us.
            </p><p> 
                This might blow your mind, but we are not reasonable creatures.
                Over the long-term, we do what feels good.
                However, we can force ourselves to do things that don't feel good for a short period of time.
            </p><p>
                Before I get to the creative side of things, it helps to understand how habits are formed.
                Going to the gym is a great example.
            </p><p>
                When we first start exercising, it is a double whammy of suck.
                It sucks before we even get there.
                Just thinking about working out will make us feel like crap.
                And it definitely sucks while we are working out.
                Finally, if we make it through, we get a release of feel-good chemicals in our brain.
            </p><p>
                Training your body to do anything habitually takes time, but most habits - like eating sweets - don't take an immense amount of effort up-front, like exercising.
                That is why it is easy to form low effort habits.
                Eventually, our body starts to understand going through this pain period makes us feel great.
                Then exercise becomes just a single whammy of suck.
                It doesn't suck before you get there because your body isn't rebelling, it knows the good feeling will come later.
                Of course, the actual workout will always be hard.
                But getting there won't.
                Boom.
                Habit formed.
            </p><p>
                When wrestling with a project commitment try and form a habit of showing up first.
                Force yourself to work long enough for the potential to be there.
                The difference between this and starting to exercise is we don't know if this project can turn into a habit.
                We know working out makes us feel good.
                But despite whatever logical story we are telling ourselves, this creative project might not.
                If it doesn't, we won't be able to show up everyday.
                If it does, then we know that we can commit to this.
                Our body will decide whether or not the project is worthwhile.
            </p><p>
                There are still other factors to consider when committing to a project.
                But there have been many times where I thought I was in love with an idea; however, I couldn't get myself to habitually work on it.
                This allowed me to stop wrestling with the commitment question altogether.

                Unnecessary confidentiality sucks
            </title>

<p>
                The downsides of confidentiality might not be considered as much as they should.
                When the people involved in a project can't talk about what they are working on, the secrecy causes inadvertent problems.
            </p><p>
                Government projects seem to hastily put shields up around their work.
                There can be good reasons for this but consider the cons.
            </p><p>
                When nobody can know what a project is, progress is only measured internally.
                This lack of outside accountability causes inefficiency to run wild.
                If the project funding is taxpayer money too, there is no significant financial risk either, only making things worse.
            </p><p>
                Since you can't tell your friends and family what you are doing, there is a lack of recognition.
                Also, since the leaders can't sell the public on this idea, the project won't be able to attract the best talent an otherwise open project would.
                Nothing kills our motivation to work like being overlooked and working with half-rate employees.
            </p><p>
                The ethical standards can start to degrade as well.
                Without information the public can't check the government's actions.
                Aside from an abuse of power, an environment where this is accepted will cause good hearted people to leave.
                Culture rot will slowly ensue.
            </p><p>
                I'm not informed enough to decide whether a project should be confidential or not.
                But have the conversation.
                Don't assume there are no downsides to unnecessary secrecy.

                Great teams are beautiful.
                If you ever get the chance to be in a group working extremely hard towards a shared interest, please give it all you've got or leave.
            </p><p>
                This is one of the rarest experiences.
                We will only get a handful of these opportunities, if we are lucky.
            </p><p>
                Great teams are more capable than the sum of their parts.
                Extra care gets compounded in ways it normally wouldn't.
                However, lack of care compounds in the opposite direction.
            </p><p>
                We should consider caring deeply.
                Nobody lives too full a life.
                And when we choose not to care and not to leave, we are corroding something beautiful and fragile.
            </p><p>
                Nothing excites me more than these rare opportunities.

                Living slowly
            </title>

<p>
<i>I enjoy living slowly.</i>
</p><p>
                This feels like: peace, contentment, mental clarity, empathy and care towards others, joy, calmness, patient ambition, confidence, curiosity.
            </p><p>
                Living fast feels like: anxiety, insufficiency, brain fog, unintentional selfishness, misdirection, hurry, restless ambition, insecurity, boredom.
            </p><p>
                The pace of my clock can be steadied by the things I do.
            </p><p>
                Some slow setting activities are: reading, writing, jogging, doing nothing, being alone, working on interesting things, focusing on one thing, silence.
            </p><p>
                Some things that will speed me up are: watching tv/Youtube, social media, notifications on my phone, working on uninteresting things, being around people for long periods of time, leaving a TV or music running in the background, or staying up to date on current world affairs.
            </p><p>
<i>Only you can figure out what speed is desirable.</i>
                I really enjoy hanging out with friends or watching a great movie just like anybody else, but the amount really matters.
                I don't want to get too sped up.
            </p><p>
<i>Slowing down is harder than speeding up.</i>
                Reading makes you smarter and running makes you healthier.
                They both can be enjoyable, but they also suck a lot of the time.
                It is work.
            </p><p>
<i>I live slowly because it makes me feel good.</i>
                We are our habits.
                Eating chocolate will make us feel good.
                Also, having a fit body will make us feel good.
                The difference is one takes a lot more effort to find.

                I love consuming great art and paying attention to what it rhymes with.
                I ask myself, what other emotions, experiences, and ideas does this cause to bubble up to my awareness?
            </p><p>
                This is fun, but it also helps me create.
                Because creating is just going the other direction.
            </p><p>
                It is being able to capture a state of being in paintings, music, text, etc.
            </p><p>
                Artists are feeling rhymers.

                How much money do we, as individuals, need?
                It seems that somewhere between 1 and 10 million dollars gives you complete freedom.
                Ya know you can work, live, and spend time however you want, more or less.
                This is a very general statement, but for brevity let's assume this is true enough.
            </p><p>
                These people are content.
                They don't want anymore money.
                They live off of the 10% interest with a S&amp;P 500 ETF.
                Now they work on whatever is fun and interesting regardless of how much it will pay, if at all.
            </p><p>
                For most people, I think this is very fulfilling.
                Perhaps, one of the most fulfilling lifestyles out there.
            </p><p>
                Why not make a company like this?
            </p><p>
                Let's say you built a company.
                It gets big and has 2 billion in cash reserves.
                Lots of companies have many more billions than that.
            </p><p>
                But then as CEO you say alright we are content.
                We are slashing all but 1000 employees.
                All costs will be paid for by the 10% interest - 2 hundred million.
                Employees get a 150k salary, so that leaves 50 million for research and development costs each year.
                We no longer care about profit.
                We will only build what is fun and interesting.
            </p><p>
                Thus, we have a perpetual company.
            </p><p>
                Maybe this becomes the most creative and awesome company ever.
                Maybe culture rot would turn it into a zombie of crappy/nonexistent products.
                But if companies are in the infinite game, this would be an optimal strategy on paper right?
                Maybe giving the company an artificial death date would protect the company's health?

                Life is hard.
                Life can be lonely.
                But sometimes you will pass someone you know.
            </p><p>
                Often, we are too busy to acknowledge them, too caught up with my our own lives.
            </p><p>
                Instead, gather all the energy you have got, smile and wave.
                It is worth it.
            </p><p>
                The happiness it brings you and them is far greater than the small amount of effort it requires.
            </p><p>
                Life is always better with a little more love.
            </p><p>
                If I know you and I don't smile and wave, remind me :)
                I probably need a smile more than usual.

                Why I don't post on social media

<i>It is addictive.</i>
                Not posting ensures that I'm spending my time on what I actually want, not what the algorithm wants.
                In general, a product that thrives on addiction gets a thumbs down from me.
            </p><p>
<i>Traditional social media posts feel too self-centered, too selfish.</i>
                It feels like I'm shouting into an open room, "Look at me!"
                I don't want to waste people's time.
                I prefer to share things that could be useful.
            </p><p>
<i>Most posts aren't a real representation of who I am.</i>
                The most significant things I do aren't Instagram material.
                I don't want likes for that one insignificant weekend trip.
                That trip is not my life nor who I am.
                It almost feels like lying.
            </p><p>
<i>Posting takes me out of the moment.</i>
                When I am with someone, I really try to give them my attention.
                I never want to be thinking about what I might post later.
                I'd rather be fully there.
                Staying present is hard enough without any distractions.
                (Although, I do wish I took more pictures, but just for me.)
            </p><p>
<i>I don't want my friends to feel like an accessory.</i>
                I think my Mom uses Facebook too much, but to each their own.
                However, I won't let her post very many pictures of me because I often feel like a trophy being flaunted.
                This isn't my Mom's intention of course.
                But I don't want to do the same thing and make my friends feel like I'm spending time with them for likes.
            </p><p>
                With all of these combined, I'm happier not posting.
                Anything worth sharing can be found here, on my website.

                I used to be terrified of telling people what songs I was currently listening to.
                I was afraid of being judged.
                (A self conscious teenager? 
                No way! Haha.)
                But I think this fear is fairly common.
            </p><p>
                Music is such a powerful medium.
                Unsurprisingly, sharing that takes a lot of vulnerability.
            </p><p>        
                The first person I ever shared my music taste with became one of my closest friends.
                We liked a lot of the same stuff, and it created a really strong bond between us.
                This upside completely caught me off guard.
                They also introduced me to a lot of great music too, which was also a first.
            </p><p>
                Because of that experience, these days I am quick to share what I'm listening to.
                I've been laughed at for sharing a song, but that is alright.
                The chance to really connect with someone makes it worthwhile.
            </p><p>
                Share your music :)
            </p><p>
                P.S. What are you listening to?
