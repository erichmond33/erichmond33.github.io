            <h1>
                My father
            </h1>
            <p>
                Some fathers run away.<br>
                Some drink all day.<br>
                Others lie, cheat, and steal.<br>
                But mine<br>
                is good.<br>
            </p><p>
                No doubt he isn't perfect.<br>
                But not lazy, selfish, or mean.<br>
                Good qualities to have<br>
                when raising a family.<br>
                Surprisingly these are free<br>
                yet today<br>
                seem to be a rarity.<br>
                Simply put, good character<br>
                means a lot to me.<br>
            </p><p>
                My father didn't change the world.<br>
                He didn't build computers, cars,<br>
                or rockets for mars.<br>
                Being moral and normal<br>
                is not indifferent.<br>
                Despite what we see on the internet<br>
                a good Father<br>
                is significant.<br>
            </p><p>
                I've never known hunger.<br>
                I've never known danger<br>
                from any person<br>
                or any stranger.<br>
                All your sacrifice<br>
                has made my life nice,<br>
                pleasant, and hopeful.<br>
                I get to dream<br>
                because you created a home.<br>
            </p><p>
                Trust me I know<br>
                I don't say this enough.<br>
                I love you.<br>
                Thank you<br>
                for being my father.<br>
            </p>
